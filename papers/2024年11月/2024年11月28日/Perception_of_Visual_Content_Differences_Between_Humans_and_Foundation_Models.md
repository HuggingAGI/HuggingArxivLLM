> Perception of Visual Content: Differences Between Humans and Foundation Models

# 摘要

> 人类标注的内容常被用于训练机器学习（ML）模型。然而，近来，语言和多模态基础模型已用于替代并增强人类标注员的工作。本研究对代表不同社会经济背景的图像的人工标注和机器学习生成的标注进行了比较。我们旨在了解感知差异，识别内容解释中的潜在偏差。我们的数据集涵盖了来自不同地理区域和收入水平的人们洗手的图像。我们从语义上对比人工标注和机器学习生成的标注，并评估它们对预测模型的影响。结果显示，从低层次视角，即出现的单词类型和句子结构看，人工标注与机器标注相似度低，但在对不同地区图像的感知相似或不同方面相似。另外，人工标注在类别层面实现了最佳的总体和最平衡的区域分类效果，而 ML 对象和 ML 标题在收入回归方面表现最优。人类和机器在感知图像时无偏差的相似性表明，他们比最初设想的更相似。使用人工标注进行区域分类和使用机器标注进行收入回归的出色且更公平的表现，凸显了图像质量和标注中的判别特征的重要性。

> Human-annotated content is often used to train machine learning (ML) models. However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study compares human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images representing diverse socio-economic contexts. We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels washing their hands. We compare human and ML-generated annotations semantically and evaluate their impact on predictive models. Our results show low similarity between human and machine annotations from a low-level perspective, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but are alike in how similar or dissimilar they perceive images across different regions. Additionally, human annotations resulted in best overall and most balanced region classification performance on the class level, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best for income regression. Humans and machines' similarity in their lack of bias when perceiving images highlights how they are more alike than what was initially perceived. The superior and fairer performance of using human annotations for region classification and machine annotations for income regression show how important the quality of the images and the discriminative features in the annotations are.
