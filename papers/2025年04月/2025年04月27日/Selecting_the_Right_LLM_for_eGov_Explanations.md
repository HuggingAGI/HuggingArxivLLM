# 摘要

> 电子政务服务质量是获得公众信任的关键，进而推动服务的进一步使用。生成式AI，特别是大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步，使得这类内容的自动化生成成为可能，从而提升解释的可解释性和准确性，更广泛地说，使内容适应不同受众。然而，为电子政务选择合适的LLM类型已成为一项非 trivial 任务。在这项工作中，我们调整了一个先前开发的评估标准，以协助这一选择过程，提供了一种系统化的方法，用于比较分析不同LLMs生成的解释质量。我们进一步通过退税流程展示了其适用性，将其作为一个典型用例，说明如何利用LLM生成退税决定的解释。这一成果通过一项用户研究实现，研究中有128名调查参与者被要求对不同版本的LLM生成的退税决定解释进行评分，从而为选择最合适的LLM提供了方法论依据。我们还开始探索自动化这一过程，尝试使用一些前沿的预测技术来模拟人类反馈，以应对此类调查的实际挑战。

> The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques.
