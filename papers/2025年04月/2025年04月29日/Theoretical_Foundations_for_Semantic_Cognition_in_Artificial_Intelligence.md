# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种基于信念形式化建模的模块化人工智能认知架构。其中，信念被定义为嵌入在可导航流形中的动态语言表达集合。通过哲学、认知科学和神经科学的多学科融合，我们构建了一个分层框架，使智能体能够进行自我调节的知识获取与反思性目标导向思维。该架构的核心是知识真空：一类语义惰性的认知状态，作为信念空间的概念起点。由此衍生出Null Tower：一种递归生成的结构，通过内部表征能力逐步构建而成。这些理论构建旨在为符号系统、神经网络系统（包括大型语言模型、混合智能体及自适应记忆架构）提供可实现的框架，为构建能够以结构化、可解释方式推理、记忆和调节信念的智能体奠定了理论基础。


> This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.
