> A Framework to Assess the Persuasion Risks Large Language Model Chatbots Pose to Democratic Societies

# 摘要

> 近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）通过其强大的说服能力对民主社会构成潜在威胁的问题引发了广泛关注。我们通过两项调查实验和一项现实世界模拟练习，拓展了现有研究，旨在确定与标准政治活动相比，使用LLM聊天机器人说服大量选民是否更具成本效益。我们的研究考虑了劝说过程中的“接收”和“接受”两个阶段（Zaller 1992）。与以往研究相比，这些实验通过评估人类与LLMs之间的延长互动（而非单一互动）以及短期和长期的劝说效果（而不仅仅是要求用户对LLM生成内容的说服力进行评分），改进了先前的工作。在涵盖三个不同政治领域的两项调查实验（N = 10,417）中，我们发现，虽然一旦选民接触到LLMs，它们的说服力与实际竞选广告相当，但现实世界中的政治劝说取决于接触到有说服力的信息及其在接触条件下的影响。通过基于现实世界参数的模拟，我们估计，考虑到接触成本，基于LLM的劝说每说服一名选民的成本在48至74美元之间，而传统竞选方法的劝说成本为100美元。然而，目前传统竞选劝说方法比基于LLM的劝说更容易扩展。尽管目前LLMs在大规模政治劝说方面的潜力似乎并不明显高于现有非LLM方法，但随着LLM能力的持续改进，以及鼓励接触有说服力的LLMs变得更加容易，这一状况可能会发生变化。

> In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller 1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects (rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage exposure to persuasive LLMs.
