> On the Potential of Large Language Models to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）已被证明是处理流程挖掘任务的有力工具。现有研究表明，它们能够支持多种数据驱动的流程分析，甚至在一定程度上能够推理流程的工作原理。这种推理能力表明，LLMs有望解决基于语义的流程挖掘任务，这类任务依赖于对活动及其关系的理解。例如，在流程发现中，活动的含义可以指示它们的依赖关系，而在异常检测中，含义可用于识别异常的流程行为。本文系统地探索了LLMs在这些任务中的能力。与之前主要评估LLMs默认状态的工作不同，我们通过上下文学习和监督微调来研究它们的实用性。具体而言，我们定义了五种需要语义理解的流程挖掘任务，并提供了广泛的基准数据集进行评估。实验表明，尽管LLMs在开箱即用或仅使用少量上下文示例时难以处理具有挑战性的流程挖掘任务，但经过针对这些任务的微调后，它们在各种流程类型和行业中都表现出了强大的性能。

> Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be valuable tools for tackling process mining tasks. Existing studies report on their capability to support various data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that there is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks, which are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and their relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the meaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly detection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is abnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default state, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks requiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with challenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal in-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across a broad range of process types and industries.
