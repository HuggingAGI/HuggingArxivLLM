# 摘要

> 电影配音技术虽已取得显著进步，但评估其在真实世界中的有效性仍具挑战性。为解决这一问题，我们引入了自适应配音基准（TA-Dubbing），旨在通过全面评估对话、旁白、独白及演员适应性，推动电影制作的进步。TA-Dubbing 具备以下优势：1) 全面维度：涵盖电影理解和语音生成的多维度评估。2) 多样化基准测试：支持评估先进电影配音模型及多模态大型语言模型。3) 完全开源：所有资源及方法均已开源，并持续更新排行榜。我们相信，TA-Dubbing 将为电影配音领域带来新的突破。

> Movie dubbing has advanced significantly, yet assessing the real-world effectiveness of these models remains challenging. A comprehensive evaluation benchmark is crucial for two key reasons: 1) Existing metrics fail to fully capture the complexities of dialogue, narration, monologue, and actor adaptability in movie dubbing. 2) A practical evaluation system should offer valuable insights to improve movie dubbing quality and advancement in film production. To this end, we introduce Talking Adaptive Dubbing Benchmarks (TA-Dubbing), designed to improve film production by adapting to dialogue, narration, monologue, and actors in movie dubbing. TA-Dubbing offers several key advantages: 1) Comprehensive Dimensions: TA-Dubbing covers a variety of dimensions of movie dubbing, incorporating metric evaluations for both movie understanding and speech generation. 2) Versatile Benchmarking: TA-Dubbing is designed to evaluate state-of-the-art movie dubbing models and advanced multi-modal large language models. 3) Full Open-Sourcing: We fully open-source TA-Dubbing at https://github.com/woka- 0a/DeepDubber- V1 including all video suits, evaluation methods, annotations. We also continuously integrate new movie dubbing models into the TA-Dubbing leaderboard at https://github.com/woka- 0a/DeepDubber-V1 to drive forward the field of movie dubbing.
