# 摘要

> 无人机（UAV）在基础设施检查、监视及相关任务中发挥着不可替代的作用，但同时也带来了严峻的安全挑战。本综述围绕分类、检测和追踪三个核心目标，对反无人机领域进行了全面考察，并介绍了扩散数据合成、多模态融合、视觉语言建模、自监督学习和强化学习等新兴方法。我们系统评估了单模态和多传感器流水线（涵盖RGB、红外、音频、雷达和射频）中的最新解决方案，并探讨了大规模和对抗性定向基准测试。分析发现，实时性能、隐身检测和群组场景中仍存在显著差距，凸显了对稳健、自适应反无人机系统的迫切需求。通过强调开放的研究方向，我们希望推动创新并为无人机广泛应用时代开发下一代防御策略提供指导。

> Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are indispensable for infrastructure inspection, surveillance, and related tasks, yet they also introduce critical security challenges. This survey provides a wide-ranging examination of the anti-UAV domain, centering on three core objectives-classification, detection, and tracking-while detailing emerging methodologies such as diffusion-based data synthesis, multi-modal fusion, vision-language modeling, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art solutions across both single-modality and multi-sensor pipelines (spanning RGB, infrared, audio, radar, and RF) and discuss large-scale as well as adversarially oriented benchmarks. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in real-time performance, stealth detection, and swarm-based scenarios, underscoring pressing needs for robust, adaptive anti-UAV systems. By highlighting open research directions, we aim to foster innovation and guide the development of next-generation defense strategies in an era marked by the extensive use of UAVs.
