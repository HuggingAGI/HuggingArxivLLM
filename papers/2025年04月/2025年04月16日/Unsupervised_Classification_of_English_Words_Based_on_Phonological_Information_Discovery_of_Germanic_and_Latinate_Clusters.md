> Unsupervised Classification of English Words Based on Phonological Information: Discovery of Germanic and Latinate Clusters

# 摘要

> 跨语言来看，本土词和借词遵循不同的语音规则。以英语为例，源自日耳曼语和拉丁语的单词在重音模式和句法结构上各有特点。然而，从认知模型的角度来看，这些基于词源的概括在可学性方面面临挑战，因为普通语言学习者无法获取词语的历史来源等信息。本研究通过计算证据表明，英语词汇中日耳曼语-拉丁语的区分可以从单个单词的音系信息中学习得到。具体而言，我们对语料库提取的单词进行了无监督聚类，所得的单词聚类结果与词源区分高度一致。模型发现的聚类还恢复了先前文献中关于相应词源类别的各种语言概括。此外，我们的研究还揭示了之前未被识别的类词源聚类特征，为未来实验研究提供了新的假设。

> Cross-linguistically, native words and loanwords follow different phonological rules. In English, for example, words of Germanic and Latinate origin exhibit different stress patterns, and a certain syntactic structure is exclusive to Germanic verbs. When seeing them as a cognitive model, however, such etymology-based generalizations face challenges in terms of learnability, since the historical origins of words are presumably inaccessible information for general language learners. In this study, we present computational evidence indicating that the Germanic-Latinate distinction in the English lexicon is learnable from the phonotactic information of individual words. Specifically, we performed an unsupervised clustering on corpus-extracted words, and the resulting word clusters largely aligned with the etymological distinction. The model-discovered clusters also recovered various linguistic generalizations documented in the previous literature regarding the corresponding etymological classes. Moreover, our findings also uncovered previously unrecognized features of the quasi-etymological clusters, offering novel hypotheses for future experimental studies.
