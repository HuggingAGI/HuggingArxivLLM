# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）工具通过即时、个性化的反馈，展现了在编程教育中提供高质量支持的潜力。然而，许多工具与机构的学习管理系统脱节，限制了其利用学习材料和背景生成定制反馈的能力。此外，以往研究主要关注知识获取，而非自我调节技能的培养。为此，我们开发了CodeRunner Agent——一个与Moodle中的CodeRunner插件集成的LLM编程助手。它使教育者能够通过整合讲义、编程问题、学生答案和执行结果等背景信息，定制AI反馈。同时，它通过策略性AI响应提升学生的自主学习能力。这种综合、情境感知、技能聚焦的方法为编程教育的改进提供了数据驱动的解决方案。

> Large Language Model (LLM) tools have demonstrated their potential to deliver high-quality assistance by providing instant, personalized feedback that is crucial for effective programming education. However, many of these tools operate independently from institutional Learning Management Systems, which creates a significant disconnect. This isolation limits the ability to leverage learning materials and exercise context for generating tailored, context-aware feedback. Furthermore, previous research on self-regulated learning and LLM support mainly focused on knowledge acquisition, not the development of important self-regulation skills. To address these challenges, we developed CodeRunner Agent, an LLM-based programming assistant that integrates the CodeRunner, a student-submitted code executing and automated grading plugin in Moodle. CodeRunner Agent empowers educators to customize AI-generated feedback by incorporating detailed context from lecture materials, programming questions, student answers, and execution results. Additionally, it enhances students' self-regulated learning by providing strategy-based AI responses. This integrated, context-aware, and skill-focused approach offers promising avenues for data-driven improvements in programming education.
