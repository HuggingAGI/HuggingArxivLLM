> Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Cybersecurity: A Systematic Survey

# 摘要

> 在技术飞速发展和数字化进程加速的背景下，网络安全威胁日益严峻，传统基于静态规则和预定义场景的安全防护手段，已难以应对现代网络攻击的快速演变。大型语言模型（LLM）的出现为网络安全防护提供了创新性解决方案，其在分析复杂攻击模式、预测威胁及实时响应辅助方面的潜力，已引发网络安全领域的广泛关注。探索如何有效利用LLM抵御网络攻击，成为当前研究热点。

本研究从网络攻击生命周期的角度，深入考察了LLM的应用价值，重点关注防御侦察、立足点建立和横向移动这三个关键阶段，并分析了其在网络安全威胁情报（CTI）任务中的潜力。同时，研究了基于LLM的安全解决方案在不同网络场景下的部署与应用实践。此外，总结了LLM在实际应用过程中所面临的内部与外部风险问题。最后，本研究还指出了该领域当前面临的风险挑战及未来可能的研究方向。

> With the rapid development of technology and the acceleration of digitalisation, the frequency and complexity of cyber security threats are increasing. Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules and predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of modern cyberattacks. There is an urgent need for more adaptive and intelligent defence strategies. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) provides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber threats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting threats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in the field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend against cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This survey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber attack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance, foothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of LLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how LLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network scenarios. It also summarizes the internal and external risk issues faced by LLM during its application. Finally, this survey also points out the facing risk issues and possible future research directions in this domain.
