# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的卓越表现不仅为学术界和工业界实现人工通用智能指明了方向，更在各类应用场景中展现了前所未有的潜力。然而，随着LLMs在研究和商业领域的影响力不断扩大，其安全性与风险问题已成为全球共同关注的焦点。目前，关于LLM安全性的研究大多局限于特定阶段，如部署或微调环节，缺乏对LLMs完整生命周期的系统性认知。为填补这一空白，本文首次提出“全栈”安全概念，旨在全面覆盖从训练到商业化部署的每个环节中的安全问题。与现有研究相比，我们的工作具有三大独特优势：(I) 全景视角：我们首次将LLM的完整生命周期定义为数据准备、预训练、后训练、部署及商业化五个阶段，构建了首个覆盖LLM全生命周期的安全框架。(II) 深度文献支持：通过对800余篇相关论文的系统性梳理，我们实现了对LLM安全问题的全面覆盖与系统性归纳。(III) 独特洞察：通过深入的文献分析，我们为每个研究领域制定了清晰的路线图与独特视角，识别出数据生成安全、对齐技术、模型编辑及LLM智能体系统等四大前沿研究方向，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

> The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.
