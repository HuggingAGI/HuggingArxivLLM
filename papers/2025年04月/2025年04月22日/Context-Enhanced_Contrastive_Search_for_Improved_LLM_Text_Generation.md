> Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search for Improved LLM Text Generation

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了显著进展。然而，生成同时具备连贯性、多样性和相关性的高质量文本仍然是一项挑战。传统解码方法如束搜索和top-k采样，在处理长文本生成任务时，往往面临输出重复或不连贯的问题。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种改进的对比搜索算法——基于上下文校准的上下文增强对比搜索（CECS）。该方案通过动态上下文重要性加权、多级对比搜索和自适应温度控制等创新方法，优化了流畅性、创造性和精确性之间的平衡。CECS的性能通过BLEU、ROUGE和语义相似度等标准指标进行了评估。实验结果显示，CECS在连贯性和相关性方面均优于现有对比搜索技术，展现出显著提升。该算法在法律文档起草、客服聊天机器人和内容营销等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

> Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, generating high-quality text that balances coherence, diversity, and relevance remains challenging. Traditional decoding methods, such as bean search and top-k sampling, often struggle with either repetitive or incoherent outputs, particularly in tasks that require long-form text generation. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel enhancement of the well-known Contrastive Search algorithm, Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search (CECS) with contextual calibration. The proposed scheme introduces several novelties including dynamic contextual importance weighting, multi-level Contrastive Search, and adaptive temperature control, to optimize the balance between fluency, creativity, and precision. The performance of CECS is evaluated using several standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both coherence and relevance of the generated texts by CECS outperforming the existing Contrastive Search techniques. The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the real world including legal document drafting, customer service chatbots, and content marketing.
