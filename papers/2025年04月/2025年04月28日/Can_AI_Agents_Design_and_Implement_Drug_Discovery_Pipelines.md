> 人工智能，特别是基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的自主智能系统，正在为药物发现领域带来革命性机遇。通过提升计算建模能力并减少对昂贵实验的依赖，AI系统在编程挑战和研究中的卓越表现，预示着其在药物设计与发现等复杂问题上将发挥更大作用。本文介绍的DO Challenge基准测试，旨在评估AI代理在虚拟筛选场景中的决策能力。该测试要求系统独立开发并执行高效策略，从海量数据中识别有潜力的分子结构，同时在多目标环境中管理资源和选择模型。通过对DO Challenge 2025竞赛的分析，我们发现人类参与者采用了多样化的策略。此外，Deep Thought多智能体系统在测试中表现突出，超越了多数人类团队。测试结果显示，Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro和o3在主要代理角色中表现优异，而GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash则在辅助角色中表现出色。尽管AI系统展现出巨大潜力，但其性能仍需进一步提升以达到专家水平，同时也暴露出了当前AI驱动方法的局限性，这为未来的研究指明了方向。

> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025, a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles, and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery and broader scientific research.
