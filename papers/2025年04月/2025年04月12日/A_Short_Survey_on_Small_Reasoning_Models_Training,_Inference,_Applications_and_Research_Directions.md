> A Short Survey on Small Reasoning Models: Training, Inference, Applications and Research Directions

# 摘要

> 大型推理模型（LRMs）如DeepSeek-R1近期通过慢思考机制取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算需求仍具挑战性。相比之下，小型推理模型（SRMs）蒸馏自大型模型，以更高效率运行，展现出独特能力。本研究系统梳理了约170篇近期论文，探讨SRMs在复杂推理任务中的应用。我们全面回顾了SRMs的现状，深入分析了相关训练和推理技术，综述了其在特定领域的应用，并展望了未来研究方向。这份调查为研究人员高效利用或开发SRMs实现高级推理功能提供了重要参考。

> Recently, the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, have seen significant advancements through the slow thinking process. Despite these achievements, the substantial computational demands of LRMs present considerable challenges. In contrast, small reasoning models (SRMs), often distilled from larger ones, offer greater efficiency and can exhibit distinct capabilities and cognitive trajectories compared to LRMs. This work surveys around 170 recently published papers on SRMs for tackling various complex reasoning tasks. We review the current landscape of SRMs and analyze diverse training and inference techniques related to SRMs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of SRMs for domain-specific applications and discuss possible future research directions. This survey serves as an essential reference for researchers to leverage or develop SRMs for advanced reasoning functionalities with high efficiency.
