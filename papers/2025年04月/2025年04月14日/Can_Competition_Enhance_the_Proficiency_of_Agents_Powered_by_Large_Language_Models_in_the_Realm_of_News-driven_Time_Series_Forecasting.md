# 摘要

> 基于多智能体的新闻驱动时间序列预测被视为在大型语言模型（LLMs）时代的一次潜在范式转变。此任务的难点在于衡量不同新闻事件对时间序列波动的影响，这要求智能体具备更强的创新思维能力和识别误导性逻辑的能力。然而，现有的多智能体讨论框架在优化这两种能力以提升时间序列预测方面效果有限。受竞争促进创新的启发，本研究在多智能体讨论中嵌入了竞争机制，以增强智能体生成创新想法的能力。此外，为了提升模型识别误导信息的能力，我们在反思阶段引入了微调后的小型LLM模型，提供辅助决策支持。实验结果证实，竞争能够提升智能体的创新思维能力，从而显著改善时间序列预测的表现。与社会科学的发现相似，本框架中竞争的强度会影响智能体的表现，为研究基于LLMs的多智能体系统提供了新的视角。

> Multi-agents-based news-driven time series forecasting is considered as a potential paradigm shift in the era of large language models (LLMs). The challenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news events towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess stronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic. However, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement on time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities. Inspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds a competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents' capability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the model's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a fine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering auxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to the findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this framework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective for studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.
