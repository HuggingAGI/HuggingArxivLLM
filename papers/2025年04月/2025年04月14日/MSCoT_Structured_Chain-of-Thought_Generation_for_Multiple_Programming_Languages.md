> MSCoT: Structured Chain-of-Thought Generation for Multiple Programming Languages

# 摘要

> 代码智能的快速发展推动了多语言编程的广泛应用，但现有代码生成模型大多专注于单一或少数几种编程语言，在多语言环境下表现欠佳。链式思维（CoT）推理通过将复杂任务分解为多个子任务逐步求解，可显著提升模型性能，无需重新训练或微调。然而，现有CoT方法主要针对Python，其他语言效果不明。为此，我们通过多智能体技术构建了涵盖12种编程语言的CoT数据集，并提出了适用于多语言的MSCoT方法。将CoT引入代码生成大模型，可提升其多语言性能。通过大规模实证研究，我们验证了MSCoT在多种语言上的优势，并设计了人类研究证明其CoT质量。最后，我们开源了MSCoT的模型和数据集，助力多语言编程研究。

> With the rapid development of code intelligence, the application of multiple programming languages is becoming increasingly widespread. However, most existing code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming languages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual environment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the performance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the code generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks into multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask. Nevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python code, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To fill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming languages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT generation method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By introducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the code generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved. Through large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization abilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple programming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple programming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the quality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and dataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple programming languages.
