> ThreMoLIA: Threat Modeling of Large Language Model-Integrated Applications

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）正在被集成到工业软件应用中，帮助用户更快完成复杂任务。然而，这些集成LLM的应用程序（LIA）增加了新的安全威胁。威胁建模是识别和缓解这些威胁的常用方法，但需要安全专家参与且耗时较长。我们与行业合作伙伴共同开发了一种新的威胁建模方法和工具，旨在：1）在LIA开发早期进行威胁建模，2）集成现有威胁模型，3）确保建模质量。我们的工具结合了LLMs和检索增强生成（RAG），利用现有威胁模型和应用架构仓库持续更新威胁模型。我们计划通过基准测试和与从业者合作来评估该工具。初步使用ChatGPT进行的评估结果令人鼓舞，我们将继续推进研究工作。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently being integrated into industrial software applications to help users perform more complex tasks in less time. However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.
