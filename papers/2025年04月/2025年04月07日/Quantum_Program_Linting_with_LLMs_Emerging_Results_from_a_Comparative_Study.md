> Quantum Program Linting with LLMs: Emerging Results from a Comparative Study

# 摘要

> 量子程序质量保障日益重要，但传统静态分析技术因其难以应对量子计算的独特性而力有未逮。为此，研究者开发了LintQ等量子专用代码检查工具，但这些工具通常依赖人工编写的分析查询，难以适应快速演进的量子编程实践。

本研究探索了运用大型语言模型（LLMs）开发新型量子软件开发代码检查技术的可行性，并展望了推进代码检查方法的潜在方向。我们推出了LintQ-LLM——一款基于LLMs的代码检查工具，其功能可与LintQ相媲美。通过实证比较研究，我们发现LintQ-LLM不仅能够与LintQ形成优势互补，还在问题定位、解释清晰度以及对新兴量子编程框架的适应性方面展现出独特优势，为未来研究奠定了基础。此外，本研究还揭示了利用LLMs开发更先进、更具适应性和反馈感知能力的量子软件质量保证方法的诸多研究机遇。

> Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing. Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices.
  To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.
