> SoK: LLM-based Log Parsing

# 摘要

> 日志数据在监控、根本原因分析和异常检测等任务中提供关键洞察，但海量的日志数据使自动化解析成为刚需。传统解析方法依赖手动配置，限制了其扩展性和实用性。得益于大型语言模型（LLMs）的突破，基于LLM的日志解析这一新兴领域应运而生，为自动化和适应性带来革新。尽管前景光明，但作为2023年底才初现的研究领域，尚未有系统性综述。本文全面梳理29种基于LLM的日志解析方法，对比其优劣与人工依赖度。我们深入剖析了各类方法的学习范式、提示工程技巧及其在解析流程中的角色，并以详尽表格汇总特征，整合所有方法形成通用解析流程。此外，我们在公开数据集上对七种开源工具进行基准测试，评估其可复现性。本研究不仅总结了该领域的最新进展，更为研究人员和从业者提供了高效易用的日志解析方案参考，所有成果均已公开以确保透明度。

> Log data, generated by software systems, provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.
