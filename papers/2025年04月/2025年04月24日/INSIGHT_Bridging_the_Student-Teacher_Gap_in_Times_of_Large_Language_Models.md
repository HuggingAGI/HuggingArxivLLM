> INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 人工智能，尤其是大型语言模型的兴起，为教育领域带来了挑战与机遇。AI有潜力通过协助教学人员实现教学方法的个性化等多样化任务来革新教育，但同时也引发了关于师生互动质量下降和用户隐私保护的担忧。本文介绍的INSIGHT项目，旨在结合多种AI工具，协助教学人员和学生在解决练习的过程中更高效地学习。INSIGHT采用模块化设计，能够灵活融入各类高等教育课程。通过分析学生向大型语言模型提出的问题并提取关键词，我们动态构建基于学生提问的FAQ，为教学人员提供新的见解，从而支持更个性化的面对面指导。未来的研究可以在此基础上，利用收集到的数据实现自适应学习，根据学生的学习进度和学习风格调整教学内容，打造更加互动和包容的学习体验。

> The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.
