# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力飞速发展，促使我们重新审视用户与设备之间的交互方式。当前，用户必须依赖多种高级应用才能达成目标。然而，AI的出现可能将这一现状改写，其通过模型生成代码为用户意图的解决提供了全新可能，这相当于生成包含众多相互依赖步骤的复杂工作流。这一突破标志着混合工作流领域的重大进展，其中人类与AI协同合作以应对用户意图，前者定义目标，后者则负责实现方案。本文研究了通过提示大型语言模型（如GPT-4o-mini）生成代码以执行工作流的可行性，例如\emph{请将我的车辆登记证书发送给我的保险公司}，并结合无图形用户界面操作系统的简化API。我们对多种用户意图、生成的代码及其执行进行了深入分析和对比。研究发现，我们的方法具有广泛适用性，且GPT-4o-mini模型在根据用户意图生成代码导向工作流方面表现尤为出色。

> The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution. The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.
