> Voice Interaction With Conversational AI Could Facilitate Thoughtful Reflection and Substantive Revision in Writing

# 摘要

> 写作不仅是表达想法，更是通过反思不断打磨的过程。研究发现，相较于静态反馈，写作中心辅导中常见的对话式反馈更能激发作者的深度思考。随着多模态大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，我们迎来了一种全新可能——利用语音交互支持写作中的反思过程。我们提出，LLM生成的静态反馈可转化为对话的起点，帮助作者寻求解释、要求示例并提出后续问题，从而深化对写作的反思。基于语音的交互能更自然地促进这种对话，引导作者关注高层次问题，逐步优化思考过程，并与文本交互相比，降低认知负担。为此，我们设计了一项研究，比较文本与语音输入对作者反思和修订的影响。研究结果将为智能写作工具的设计提供洞见，揭示基于语音的交互如何通过LLM驱动的对话代理助力写作反思与改进。

> Writing well requires not only expressing ideas but also refining them through revision, a process facilitated by reflection. Prior research suggests that feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center tutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work compared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and expressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that LLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters, allowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up questions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that voice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange, encouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating iterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared to text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a formative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers' reflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the design of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how voice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support reflection and revision.
