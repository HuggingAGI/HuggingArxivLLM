区块链共识机制传统上依赖工作量证明（PoW）和权益证明（PoS）等算法来保障网络功能与数据完整性。然而，这些方法在需要综合考量各方意见而非单纯依赖多数或加权共识的决策场景中，面临着适应性挑战。本文提出了一种基于商议的新型共识机制，让大型语言模型（LLMs）作为理性主体，通过结构化的讨论达成全体一致的共识。通过引入分级共识和多轮商议流程，我们的方法确保了对明确问题的一致共识，同时为优先级决策和政策提供了分级信心。我们对系统进行了形式化描述，证明区块链的核心属性——一致性、协议、活性和确定性均得到了有效保持。此外，实验结果验证了我们系统的可行性，展示了我们的商议方法如何通过其收敛性、区块特性和准确性赋能区块链网络的决策制定。我们还深入探讨了这一创新方法所面临的关键挑战，包括思维退化、幻觉、恶意模型和节点、资源消耗以及可扩展性。


> Blockchain consensus mechanisms have relied on algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to ensure network functionality and integrity. However, these approaches struggle with adaptability for decision-making where the opinions of each matter rather than reaching an agreement based on honest majority or weighted consensus. This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures both unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded confidence for prioritized decisions and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains: consistency, agreement, liveness, and determinism are maintained. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate our system's feasibility, showcasing how our deliberation method's convergence, block properties, and accuracy enable decision-making on blockchain networks. We also address key challenges with this novel approach such as degeneration of thoughts, hallucinations, malicious models and nodes, resource consumption, and scalability.
