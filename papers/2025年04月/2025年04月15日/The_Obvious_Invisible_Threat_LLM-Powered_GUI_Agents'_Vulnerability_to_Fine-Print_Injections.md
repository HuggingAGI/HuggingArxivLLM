> The Obvious Invisible Threat: LLM-Powered GUI Agents' Vulnerability to Fine-Print Injections

# 摘要

> LLM驱动的GUI代理是一种代表用户根据指令自主执行任务的系统。它通过解析应用界面、推断操作序列并执行点击、输入等操作来完成任务。然而，处理敏感数据的自主性也带来了隐私和安全风险。攻击者可能通过视觉差异或上下文检测限制，向界面注入恶意内容，诱导信息泄露或改变代理行为。本文对六种攻击进行了分类，并通过实验测试了六种先进代理、234个对抗网页和39名用户。结果显示，GUI代理极易受到嵌入式威胁攻击，人类用户也难以完全防范这些攻击。这表明需要开发隐私感知型代理，并提出了实用防御策略，以指导更安全可靠的GUI代理开发。

> A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous system that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level instructions. It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.
