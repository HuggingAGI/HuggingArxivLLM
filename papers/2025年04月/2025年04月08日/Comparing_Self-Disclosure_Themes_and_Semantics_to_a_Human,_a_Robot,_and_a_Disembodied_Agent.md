# 摘要

> 随着社交机器人和其他人工代理的对话能力日益增强，理解人们在与不同具身性代理互动时的自我披露内容和意义变得尤为重要。本研究基于三项受控实验的对话数据，分析了参与者向人类、类人社交机器人和无身对话代理进行自我披露的情况。通过句嵌入和聚类分析，我们识别了参与者披露的主题，并利用大型语言模型对这些主题进行标注和解释。研究发现，尽管具身性可能会影响人与机器人及人与代理交互中的行为，但人们在向人类或人工交流者披露时，往往会保持一致的主题焦点和语义结构，披露内容的表达方式也高度相似。这一发现表明，自我披露的核心主题和语义结构在不同交互场景中具有较强的一致性。

> As social robots and other artificial agents become more conversationally capable, it is important to understand whether the content and meaning of self-disclosure towards these agents changes depending on the agent's embodiment. In this study, we analysed conversational data from three controlled experiments in which participants self-disclosed to a human, a humanoid social robot, and a disembodied conversational agent. Using sentence embeddings and clustering, we identified themes in participants' disclosures, which were then labelled and explained by a large language model. We subsequently assessed whether these themes and the underlying semantic structure of the disclosures varied by agent embodiment. Our findings reveal strong consistency: thematic distributions did not significantly differ across embodiments, and semantic similarity analyses showed that disclosures were expressed in highly comparable ways. These results suggest that while embodiment may influence human behaviour in human-robot and human-agent interactions, people tend to maintain a consistent thematic focus and semantic structure in their disclosures, whether speaking to humans or artificial interlocutors.
