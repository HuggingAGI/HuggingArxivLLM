# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的智能体在各种任务中表现出了卓越的能力，但在需要特定知识、灵活性或可问责决策的任务上仍存在局限。这些智能体虽然能够感知环境、推理、规划并执行目标导向的动作，却常面临幻觉和跨交互情境记忆缺失的问题。本文研究了如何将案例推理（CBR）——一种通过参考以往经验解决新问题的策略——融入LLM智能体框架，以利用显性知识提升其效能。我们系统性地梳理了增强型智能体的理论基础，明确了关键组件，并为案例检索、适应和学习等CBR过程构建了数学模型。此外，我们对比了CBR增强型智能体与其他方法（如链式思维推理和标准检索增强生成）的表现，分析了其优劣。进一步地，我们探讨了通过目标驱动的自主机制，利用CBR的认知维度（如自我反思、内省和好奇心）来提升LLM智能体能力的潜力。这项研究为神经符号混合系统的探索提供了新视角，提出CBR作为提升自主LLM智能体推理和认知能力的可行方案。

> Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.
