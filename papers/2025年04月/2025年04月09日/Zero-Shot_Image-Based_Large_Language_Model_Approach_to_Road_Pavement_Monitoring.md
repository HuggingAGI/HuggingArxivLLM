# 摘要

> 路面状况评估对维护优先级、交通安全及车辆损耗至关重要。传统人工检查主观性强，机器学习方法受限于数据依赖，而大型语言模型（LLMs）的突破为这一领域带来革命性变化。本研究提出了一种基于零样本学习的创新方法，结合LLMs的图像识别与自然语言理解能力，有效评估道路状况。我们开发了多种基于LLMs的评估模型，并采用与路面状况指数（PSCI）标准相匹配的提示工程策略。通过对比官方PSCI结果，评估了这些模型的性能，并最终选定优化模型。利用Google Street View图像，我们对优化模型进行了广泛测试，与不同级别专家的评估结果进行了对比。结果显示，基于LLMs的方法在道路状况评估中表现出色，优化模型通过全面且结构化的提示工程策略实现了高准确性和一致性，超越了简单配置，并在某些情况下优于专家评估。此外，成功将优化模型应用于Google Street View图像，证明了其在城市规模部署中的潜力。这些发现不仅凸显了LLMs在道路评估中的变革潜力，也强调了详细提示工程在实现可靠评估中的关键作用。

> Effective and rapid evaluation of pavement surface condition is critical for prioritizing maintenance, ensuring transportation safety, and minimizing vehicle wear and tear. While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments.
