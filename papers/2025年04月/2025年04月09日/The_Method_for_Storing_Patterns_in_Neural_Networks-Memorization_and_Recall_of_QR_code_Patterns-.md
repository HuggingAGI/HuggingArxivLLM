# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种在神经网络中存储和回忆复杂模式的机制。该模型基于我们2018年的工作（Inazawa, 2018），经过改进和扩展。随着深度学习和基于大型语言模型（LLM）的人工智能技术（生成式AI）的最新进展，学习方法正逐渐成熟。未来，基于Transformer模型（Vaswani, et al., 2017, Rae, et al., 2020）的记忆研究可能会进一步发展，但本文提出了一种更简单且功能更强大的神经网络记忆与回忆模型。在神经网络中存储模式的优势在于，即使呈现的是不完整版本，它也能准确回忆起原始模式。我们在研究中使用的模式是二维码（DENSO WAVE, 1994），近年来，二维码已成为广泛使用的信息传输工具。

> In this paper, we propose a mechanism for storing complex patterns within a neural network and subsequently recalling them. This model is based on our work published in 2018(Inazawa, 2018), which we have refined and extended in this work. With the recent advancements in deep learning and large language model (LLM)-based AI technologies (generative AI), it can be considered that methodologies for the learning are becoming increasingly well-established. In the future, we expect to see further research on memory using models based on Transformers (Vaswani, et. al., 2017, Rae, et. al., 2020), but in this paper we propose a simpler and more powerful model of memory and recall in neural networks. The advantage of storing patterns in a neural network lies in its ability to recall the original pattern even when an incomplete version is presented. The patterns we have produced for use in this study have been QR code (DENSO WAVE, 1994), which has become widely used as an information transmission tool in recent years.
