# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律文件的分析与合成中发挥着越来越重要的作用，推动了法律信息总结、分类和检索等任务的自动化。本研究通过系统性文献综述，深入探讨了法律语境下大型语言模型的提示工程前沿。研究发现，GPT-4、BERT、Llama 2 和 Legal-Pegasus 等模型在法律领域得到了广泛应用，少样本学习、零样本学习和链式思维提示等技术有效提升了法律文本的解读能力。然而，模型偏差和幻觉等问题仍制约着这些技术的大规模落地。尽管大型语言模型在法律领域展现出巨大潜力，但要实现更高水平的准确性和可靠性，还需进一步优化提示工程策略。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize the analysis and synthesis of legal documents, enabling the automation of tasks such as summarization, classification, and retrieval of legal information. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the state of the art in prompt engineering applied to LLMs in the legal context. The results indicate that models such as GPT-4, BERT, Llama 2, and Legal-Pegasus are widely employed in the legal field, and techniques such as Few-shot Learning, Zero-shot Learning, and Chain-of-Thought prompting have proven effective in improving the interpretation of legal texts. However, challenges such as biases in models and hallucinations still hinder their large-scale implementation. It is concluded that, despite the great potential of LLMs for the legal field, there is a need to improve prompt engineering strategies to ensure greater accuracy and reliability in the generated results.
