# 摘要

> 大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，尤其在语言生成、翻译和推理等任务中表现出色。然而，其高计算需求限制了它们在普通设备上的应用，这一问题在资源匮乏的伊比利亚半岛语言中尤为突出。本研究对几种精简的前沿大型语言模型进行了全面评估，针对伊比利亚语言的多项关键NLP任务进行了测试。结果显示，尽管某些模型在特定任务上表现优异，但整体性能差距依然显著，特别是在巴斯克语等语言上。这些发现凸显了在平衡模型精简性与强大的多语言性能方面，进一步研究的必要性。

> Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as language generation, translation, and reasoning. However, their substantial computational requirements restrict deployment to high-end systems, limiting accessibility on consumer-grade devices. This challenge is especially pronounced for under-resourced languages like those spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, where relatively limited linguistic resources and benchmarks hinder effective evaluation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of compact state-of-the-art LLMs across several essential NLP tasks tailored for Iberian languages. The results reveal that while some models consistently excel in certain tasks, significant performance gaps remain, particularly for languages such as Basque. These findings highlight the need for further research on balancing model compactness with robust multilingual performance
