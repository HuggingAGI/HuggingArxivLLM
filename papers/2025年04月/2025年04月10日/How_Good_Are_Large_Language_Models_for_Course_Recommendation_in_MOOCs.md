# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，并逐渐被整合到推荐系统中。然而，它们在教育推荐系统中的潜力尚未得到充分挖掘。本文探讨了将LLMs作为通用推荐模型的可能性，利用其从大规模语料库中获取的丰富知识，应用于课程推荐任务。我们研究了多种方法，从基于提示的方法到更高级的微调技术，并将其与传统推荐模型进行了性能对比。我们在一个真实的MOOC数据集上进行了大量实验，从准确性、多样性和新颖性等关键维度评估了将LLMs用作课程推荐系统的效果。实验结果表明，LLMs能够实现与传统模型相当的良好性能，凸显了其在提升教育推荐系统方面的潜力。这些发现为在教育推荐背景下进一步探索和开发基于LLMs的方法奠定了基础。
    

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing and are increasingly being integrated into recommendation systems. However, their potential in educational recommendation systems has yet to be fully explored. This paper investigates the use of LLMs as a general-purpose recommendation model, leveraging their vast knowledge derived from large-scale corpora for course recommendation tasks. We explore a variety of approaches, ranging from prompt-based methods to more advanced fine-tuning techniques, and compare their performance against traditional recommendation models. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real-world MOOC dataset, evaluating using LLMs as course recommendation systems across key dimensions such as accuracy, diversity, and novelty. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve good performance comparable to traditional models, highlighting their potential to enhance educational recommendation systems. These findings pave the way for further exploration and development of LLM-based approaches in the context of educational recommendations.
