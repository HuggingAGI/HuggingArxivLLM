> Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair

# 摘要

> 近年来，漏洞发现速度不断加快，但手动修复不仅需要专业知识，还耗时耗力。因此，许多已知甚至已公开的漏洞仍未修复，导致软件系统面临更大风险。基于大型语言模型的代理在代码理解和生成方面展现出巨大潜力，但基于静态信息检索的代理在补丁生成方面仍显不足。为解决这一难题，我们提出了一种名为 VulDebugger 的修复代理，它结合静态和动态上下文，以类似人类的方式进行程序调试。通过调试器，VulDebugger 检查程序实际状态，并通过约束条件推断预期状态。通过持续对比，它深入理解漏洞根源并完成修复。在50个真实项目上的实验表明，VulDebugger 的修复成功率高达60%，显著优于现有最优方法。

> In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.
