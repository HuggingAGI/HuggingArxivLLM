> Enhancements for Developing a Comprehensive AI Fairness Assessment Standard

# 摘要

> AI系统日益影响电信、金融、医疗和公共服务等关键领域，保障决策公平性至关重要，以避免对弱势群体造成不公影响或引发负面后果。这一需求在迈向6G时代之际尤为紧迫，届时AI将驱动复杂的自主网络管理与超个性化服务等功能。TEC标准为AI系统的公平性评估与评级提供了指导，主要聚焦于表格数据与监督学习模型。然而，随着AI应用的多样化，该标准亟需完善以强化其影响并扩大适用范围。本文提议扩展TEC标准，纳入针对图像、非结构化文本及生成式AI（包括大型语言模型）的公平性评估，构建更全面的框架以紧跟AI技术的演进步伐。通过整合这些维度，增强后的框架将推动各行业负责任且可信赖的AI部署。

> As AI systems increasingly influence critical sectors like telecommunications, finance, healthcare, and public services, ensuring fairness in decision-making is essential to prevent biased or unjust outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable entities or result in adverse impacts. This need is particularly pressing as the industry approaches the 6G era, where AI will drive complex functions like autonomous network management and hyper-personalized services. The TEC Standard for Fairness Assessment and Rating of AI Systems provides guidelines for evaluating fairness in AI, focusing primarily on tabular data and supervised learning models. However, as AI applications diversify, this standard requires enhancement to strengthen its impact and broaden its applicability. This paper proposes an expansion of the TEC Standard to include fairness assessments for images, unstructured text, and generative AI, including large language models, ensuring a more comprehensive approach that keeps pace with evolving AI technologies. By incorporating these dimensions, the enhanced framework will promote responsible and trustworthy AI deployment across various sectors.
