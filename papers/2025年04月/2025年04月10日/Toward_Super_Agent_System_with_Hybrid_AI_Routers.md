> 大型语言模型驱动的AI代理正通过广泛应用改变世界。超级代理通过准确理解用户意图并利用适当工具完成任务，能够满足多样化的用户需求，如总结、编码和研究。然而，为了使此类代理能够投入实际应用并在大规模范围内使用，必须进行重大优化以确保高效性和低成本。本文提出了一种超级代理系统的设计方案。在接收到用户提示后，系统首先检测用户的意图，然后将请求路由到具有必要工具的专用任务代理，或自动生成智能工作流。在实际应用中，大多数应用直接作为AI助手在边缘设备（如手机和机器人）上运行。由于不同语言模型的能力各不相同，且基于云的模型通常涉及高计算成本、延迟和隐私问题，我们随后探讨了混合模式，其中路由器会根据任务复杂性动态选择本地或云端模型。最后，我们介绍了增强云能力的设备端超级代理蓝图。随着多模态模型和边缘硬件的进步，我们设想大多数计算可以在本地处理，仅在需要时与云端协作。这种架构为超级代理在未来无缝融入日常生活铺平了道路。

> AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.
