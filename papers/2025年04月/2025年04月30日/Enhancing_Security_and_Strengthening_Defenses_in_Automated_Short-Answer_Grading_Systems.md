> 本研究聚焦于医学教育中基于Transformer的自动简答题评分系统的漏洞，特别是如何通过对抗性游戏策略对其进行操控。我们识别出三种主要的系统弱点利用策略，可能引发误判。为应对这些漏洞，我们采用了多种对抗训练方法，显著增强了系统的鲁棒性。研究发现，结合集成技术（如多数投票和岭回归）的对抗训练方法，能有效提升系统抵御复杂对抗输入的能力。此外，利用GPT-4等大型语言模型，并通过多样化提示技术，已被证明能有效识别和评分游戏策略。本研究强调了在高风险环境下，持续改进AI驱动教育工具的重要性，以确保其可靠性和公平性。

> This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.
