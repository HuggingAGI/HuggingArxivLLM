# 摘要

> 本报告旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解答高中科学问题方面的表现，并探讨其在教育领域的应用潜力。随着LLMs在自然语言处理领域的快速发展，其在教育领域的应用引起了广泛关注。本研究选取了2019至2023年高考中的数学试题作为评估数据，并利用至少八个LLM API提供答案。基于准确率、响应时间、逻辑推理和创造力等指标，进行了全面评估。通过对评估结果的深入分析，本报告揭示了LLMs在处理高中科学问题方面的优势与不足，并探讨了其对教育实践的启示。研究发现，尽管LLMs在某些方面表现出色，但在逻辑推理和创造性问题解决方面仍有提升空间。本报告为LLMs在教育领域的进一步研究和应用提供了实证基础，并提出了改进建议。

> This report aims to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving high school science questions and to explore their potential applications in the educational field. With the rapid development of LLMs in the field of natural language processing, their application in education has attracted widespread attention. This study selected mathematics exam questions from the college entrance examinations (2019-2023) as evaluation data and utilized at least eight LLM APIs to provide answers. A comprehensive assessment was conducted based on metrics such as accuracy, response time, logical reasoning, and creativity. Through an in-depth analysis of the evaluation results, this report reveals the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in handling high school science questions and discusses their implications for educational practice. The findings indicate that although LLMs perform excellently in certain aspects, there is still room for improvement in logical reasoning and creative problem-solving. This report provides an empirical foundation for further research and application of LLMs in the educational field and offers suggestions for improvement.
