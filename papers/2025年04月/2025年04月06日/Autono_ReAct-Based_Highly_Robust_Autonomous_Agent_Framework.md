# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种基于ReAct范式的高鲁棒性自主智能体框架，通过自适应决策机制和多智能体协作来解决复杂任务。与传统框架不同，本框架在执行过程中基于历史轨迹动态生成下一步动作，显著提升了鲁棒性。为了解决不适应性路径可能导致的终止问题，我提出了一种结合概率惩罚机制的及时终止策略。在多智能体协作方面，我引入了记忆转移机制，使智能体之间能够共享并动态更新记忆。该框架的创新及时终止策略通过概率惩罚动态调整任务终止概率，开发者可通过调节超参数平衡智能体执行策略中的保守与探索倾向。这显著提高了复杂环境中的适应能力和任务执行效率。此外，通过外部工具集成和模块化设计，智能体支持灵活的动作空间扩展，得益于MCP协议兼容性。通过显式的劳动分工，多智能体协作机制使智能体专注于特定任务组件，从而显著提升了执行效率和质量。

> This paper proposes a highly robust autonomous agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm, designed to solve complex tasks through adaptive decision making and multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on fixed workflows generated by LLM-based planners, this framework dynamically generates next actions during agent execution based on prior trajectories, thereby enhancing its robustness. To address potential termination issues caused by adaptive execution paths, I propose a timely abandonment strategy incorporating a probabilistic penalty mechanism. For multi-agent collaboration, I introduce a memory transfer mechanism that enables shared and dynamically updated memory among agents. The framework's innovative timely abandonment strategy dynamically adjusts the probability of task abandonment via probabilistic penalties, allowing developers to balance conservative and exploratory tendencies in agent execution strategies by tuning hyperparameters. This significantly improves adaptability and task execution efficiency in complex environments. Additionally, agents can be extended through external tool integration, supported by modular design and MCP protocol compatibility, which enables flexible action space expansion. Through explicit division of labor, the multi-agent collaboration mechanism enables agents to focus on specific task components, thereby significantly improving execution efficiency and quality.
