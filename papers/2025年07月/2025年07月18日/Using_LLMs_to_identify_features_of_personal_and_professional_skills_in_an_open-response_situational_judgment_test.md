# 摘要

> 越来越多的学术项目认识到，个人和专业技能与技术专长一样，对学生的未来职业成功至关重要。随着这一需求的增长，我们需要建立可扩展的系统来衡量、评估和发展这些技能。情境判断测试（SJT）提供了一种标准化、可靠的评估途径，但传统的开放式SJT依赖人工评分，这在大规模应用时面临挑战。此前，基于NLP的SJT评分系统开发因构建效度问题未能成功。本文提出了一种新方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）从SJT反应中提取与构建相关特征。以Casper SJT为例，我们验证了该方法的有效性。这项研究为未来在个人和专业技能自动化评分领域的进一步发展奠定了基础。

> Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.
