> Large Language Models as Innovators: A Framework to Leverage Latent Space Exploration for Novelty Discovery

# 摘要

> 创意生成仍是AI领域的核心挑战，大型语言模型（LLMs）虽流畅但常受限于训练模式，难以自然发散。现有解决方案多依赖特定领域方法，效果有限且难以推广。本文提出了一种新型潜在空间构思框架，通过探索创意的连续嵌入空间，实现受控且可扩展的创造力。无需手动规则，轻松适应各类任务，本文展示了早期原型及初步成果，彰显其作为人机协作通用创意伙伴的潜力。

> Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.
