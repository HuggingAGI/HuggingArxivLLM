> 数据驱动技术为化学科学带来了巨大变革与加速潜力，但这一领域也面临独特挑战：数据集多样、样本量小且模糊，难以被传统机器学习方法充分利用。一类新兴的通用模型（GPMs），如大型语言模型，已展现出解决未直接训练任务的能力，并能在不同格式下灵活处理少量数据。本文综述了GPMs的基本构建原则，并全面回顾了其在化学科学研究全流程中的最新应用。尽管诸多应用尚处于原型阶段，但随着GPMs关注度的持续升温，我们期待这些应用将在未来几年走向成熟。

> Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.
