> 数字孪生（DTs）在网络安全领域日益重要，因其能够复制复杂的IT、OT和IoT基础设施，支持实时监控、威胁分析和系统仿真。本研究探讨将DTs与渗透测试工具及大型语言模型（LLMs）相结合，以提升网络安全教育和操作准备。通过模拟现实的网络环境，此方法提供了一个实用且交互式的框架，用于探索漏洞和防御策略。本研究的核心是红队刀具（RTK），一款与网络杀伤链模型相契合的定制渗透测试工具包。RTK旨在引导学习者逐步掌握网络攻击的关键阶段，包括在DT驱动的生态系统中的侦察、利用和响应。大型语言模型（LLMs）的引入进一步丰富了学习体验，通过在训练演习中提供智能实时反馈、自然语言威胁解释和自适应学习支持。这一结合DT和LLM的框架目前在学术环境中试点，旨在培养漏洞评估、威胁检测和安全运营的实际操作技能。初步结果显示，这种整合显著提升了网络安全培训的有效性和相关性，缩小了理论知识与实际应用之间的差距。最终，本研究展示了DTs和LLMs如何共同革新网络安全教育，以满足行业不断演变的需求。

> Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.
