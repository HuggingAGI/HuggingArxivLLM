> Fair Compromises in Participatory Budgeting: a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach

# 摘要

> 参与式预算是通过集体理解和解决支出优先级的一种方法，民众投票决定预算的使用方式，定期运行以提高公共资金分配的公平性。参与式预算要求选民对项目做出决策，这可能导致“选择过载”。一种基于多智能体强化学习的决策支持方法可以通过识别提高选民投票胜率的投票策略，使选民的决策变得更加容易。这种方法还可以支持政策制定者，通过强调选举设计中促进项目公平妥协的方面。本文提出了一种新型的、符合伦理的决策支持方法，采用多智能体深度强化学习建模。本文引入了一种新型的分支神经网络架构，以一种去中心化的方式克服多智能体强化学习的可扩展性挑战。通过优化选民行动，使获胜项目更能代表选民偏好，从而实现公平妥协。使用真实世界的参与式预算数据进行的实验评估揭示了公平妥协的模式：即通过低成本项目即可实现。


> Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds. Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is achievable through projects with smaller cost.
