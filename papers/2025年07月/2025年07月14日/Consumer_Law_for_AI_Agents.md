> Consumer Law for AI Agents

# 摘要

> 自2022年11月ChatGPT公开发布以来，AI领域正经历一场快速变革。目前，消费者对AI聊天机器人的使用大多局限于图像生成或问答语言模型。下一代AI系统——仅需有限人类干预即可规划和执行复杂任务的AI代理——将能够执行范围广泛得多的操作。特别地，消费者很快就能将采购决策委托给作为Custobots的AI代理。在此背景下，本文探讨了现行欧盟消费者法是否已准备好应对Custobot经济的崛起。通过这项研究，本文做出了三项贡献：首先，概述了AI代理的出现如何改变现有的电子商务格局；其次，解释了AI代理如何挑战基于人类决策假设的人本主义消费者法的基础；最后，提出了一些初步思考，探讨未来的消费者法应如何制定，以同时服务于人类和机器。

> Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI landscape is undergoing a rapid transformation. Currently, the use of AI chatbots by consumers has largely been limited to image generation or question-answering language models. The next generation of AI systems, AI agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement, will be capable of a much broader range of actions. In particular, consumers could soon be able to delegate purchasing decisions to AI agents acting as Custobots. Against this background, the Article explores whether EU consumer law, as it currently stands, is ready for the rise of the Custobot Economy. In doing so, the Article makes three contributions. First, it outlines how the advent of AI agents could change the existing e-commerce landscape. Second, it explains how AI agents challenge the premises of a human-centric consumer law which is based on the assumption that consumption decisions are made by humans. Third, the Article presents some initial considerations how a future consumer law could look like that works for both humans and machines.
