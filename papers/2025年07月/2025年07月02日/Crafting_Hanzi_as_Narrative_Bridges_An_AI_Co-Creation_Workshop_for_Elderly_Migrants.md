> Crafting Hanzi as Narrative Bridges: An AI Co-Creation Workshop for Elderly Migrants

# 摘要

> 本文聚焦老年群体，特别是中国城市中的老年移民，探讨他们如何借助AI辅助共创，将那些支离破碎、代表性不足或难以言表的个人故事进行生动表达。通过一场结合口头叙述与汉字符号重构的试点工作坊，参与者分享了迁移记忆，并利用大型语言模型（LLM）建议的小篆字体以及实物材料共同创作了新的字符形式。在人工引导和温和的AI存在下，参与者将生活经历转化为视觉和触觉表达，无需具备数字素养。这种方法通过重新定位AI，将其视为支持机制而非内容生产者，并在社会技术系统中支持叙述自主权，为人类与AI协作及老龄化问题提供了全新的视角。

> This paper explores how older adults, particularly aging migrants in urban China, can engage AI-assisted co-creation to express personal narratives that are often fragmented, underrepresented, or difficult to verbalize. Through a pilot workshop combining oral storytelling and the symbolic reconstruction of Hanzi, participants shared memories of migration and recreated new character forms using Xiaozhuan glyphs, suggested by the Large Language Model (LLM), together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile expressions without requiring digital literacy. This approach offers new perspectives on human-AI collaboration and aging by repositioning AI not as a content producer but as a supportive mechanism, and by supporting narrative agency within sociotechnical systems.
