> Large Language Model Agent for Structural Drawing Generation Using ReAct Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation

# 摘要

> 结构图在机械工程、土木工程等领域广泛应用。在土木工程中，结构图是建筑师、工程师和建筑商沟通的主要工具，用于避免冲突、作为法律文件，并为未来维护或评估提供参考。它们通过标题/副标题块、比例尺、平面视图、立面图、剖面图和详细剖面图等关键元素组织，使用标准化符号和线型标注，便于工程师和承包商解读。尽管软件功能进步，但生成结构图对结构工程师仍是一项耗时费力的任务。我们提出一种基于生成式AI的新方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）代理生成结构图。该方法采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，利用外部事实提升模型准确性和可靠性。它能理解多种自然语言描述，提取必要信息并生成代码，在AutoCAD中生成所需结构图。本文方法实现了结构图自然语言描述到AutoCAD绘图的高效直接转换，显著减少工作量，助力工程师以简化方式表达设计思想。

> Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.
