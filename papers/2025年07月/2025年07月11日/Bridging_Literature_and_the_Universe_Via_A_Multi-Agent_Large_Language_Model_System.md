# 摘要

> 随着宇宙学模拟软件的日益复杂，物理学家在从海量文献中提取模拟参数时面临巨大挑战。这些参数不仅分散在使用不同模型和格式的学术论文中，将其转化为可执行脚本的过程也耗时费力且容易出错。为解决这一难题并加速宇宙学研究，我们开发了SimAgents——一个专注于自动化参数配置和初步分析的多智能体系统。SimAgents搭载了具备物理推理、模拟软件验证和工具执行能力的专用LLM代理，通过结构化协作确保参数提取的科学性和一致性。我们还构建了一个包含40多个模拟案例的评估数据集，涵盖多种模拟类型，实验结果充分证明了SimAgents的卓越性能。演示视频及完整系统已开放获取。

> As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.
