> Finding Common Ground: Using Large Language Models to Detect Agreement in Multi-Agent Decision Conferences

# 摘要

> 决策会议是汇聚多领域专家、探讨复杂问题并达成共识的结构化协作会议，通常依赖有组织的讨论确保高效对话与集体协议。近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟现实场景方面展现出巨大潜力，尤其是在通过协作式多智能体系统模拟群体互动方面。本研究提出了一种基于LLMs的多智能体系统，专注于模拟决策会议并检测参与者智能体之间的一致性。我们对六种LLMs在两项任务上进行了评估：立场检测（识别智能体在某一问题上的立场）和立场极性检测（识别智能体情感倾向：正面、负面或中性）。这些模型在多智能体系统中的表现进一步验证了它们在复杂模拟中的有效性。研究发现，LLMs即使在动态且微妙的辩论中也能可靠地检测一致性。在系统中加入一致性检测智能体，可提升群体辩论效率并优化讨论质量与连贯性，使其成果与决策过程媲美现实决策会议。这些发现不仅凸显了基于LLMs的多智能体系统在模拟群体决策中的潜力，也表明其在跨领域专家征询与决策支持方面具有重要应用价值。

> Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work, we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops across various domains.
