> Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)

# 摘要

> 我们揭示了四个重要思维理论之间意外的结构趋同：Kahneman的双系统理论、Friston的预测处理理论、Minsky的思维社会理论以及Clark的延展心智理论。这种趋同现象出现在一种名为Agentic Flow的实用AI代理架构中。该架构专为克服大型语言模型（LLMs）的局限性而设计，由检索、认知、控制、记忆和行动五个相互依赖的模块组成，这些模块以循环认知环的形式协同工作。虽然最初仅受到Minsky和Clark的启发，但Agentic Flow的结构在回顾中与所有四个理论中的核心计算模式相吻合，包括预测建模、联想回忆以及对误差敏感的控制机制。

> We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow. Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical unification.
