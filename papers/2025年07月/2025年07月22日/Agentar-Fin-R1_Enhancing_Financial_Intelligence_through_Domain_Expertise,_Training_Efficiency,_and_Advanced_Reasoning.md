# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLMs) 在金融领域展现出巨大潜力，但在需要强推理能力、高可信度及任务适配性的场景下，现有模型仍显不足。我们推出 Agentar-Fin-R1 系列金融大语言模型（80亿和320亿参数），基于 Qwen3 基础模型打造，专为提升金融场景中的推理能力、可靠性和领域专精性而设计。我们的优化方案融合了高质量、系统化的金融任务分类法与全面的多层可信度保障框架，包含可信知识工程、可信数据合成及数据治理。通过难度感知优化、两阶段学习及归属系统，训练效率显著提升。模型在 FinEva、FinEval、FinanceIQ 等金融基准测试及 MATH-500、GPQA 等通用推理数据集上表现优异。为全面评估实际应用能力，我们创新性地提出了专注于金融推理与合规验证的 Finova 评估基准。实验结果表明，Agentar-Fin-R1 不仅在金融任务上达到顶尖水准，还在通用推理能力上表现出色，验证了其作为高风险金融应用中值得信赖的解决方案的潜力。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate tremendous potential in the financial domain, yet existing models often fall short in scenarios demanding robust reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness requirements, and efficient adaptation to task-specific needs. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications.
