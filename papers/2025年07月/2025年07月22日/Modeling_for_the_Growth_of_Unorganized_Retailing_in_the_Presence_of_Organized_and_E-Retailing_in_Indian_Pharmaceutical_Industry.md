# 摘要

> 本研究聚焦印度农村药品零售行业，探讨有组织零售商和电子零售商的进入对无组织零售商生存策略的挑战。基于实地调查，结合一手数据收集、消费者联合分析和实验设计，本研究构建了一个基于实证的智能体仿真模型，用于模拟无组织、有组织及电子药品零售商间的多渠道竞争。联合分析表明，门店属性中的价格折扣、产品品质、商品种类及个性化服务水平，以及消费者属性中的距离、移动性及紧急程度，是决定最优门店选择的关键因素。智能体建模揭示，零售商的属性水平会影响其他零售商的表现。仿真结果还显示，无组织零售商的价格折扣增加最初会提升其客户流量，但最终可能导致其退出市场。因此，无组织零售商应避免将价格折扣提升至临界点以上。此外，研究发现高紧急程度的顾客比低紧急程度的顾客更不重视商品种类的丰富度。本研究为改善印度药品零售行业竞争动态的政策设计提供了重要见解。

> The present study considers the rural pharmaceutical retail sector in India, where the arrival of organized retailers and e-retailers is testing the survival strategies of unorganized retailers. Grounded in a field investigation of the Indian pharmaceutical retail sector, this study integrates primary data collection, consumer conjoint analysis and design of experiments to develop an empirically grounded agent-based simulation of multi-channel competition among unorganized, organized and e-pharmaceutical retailers. The results of the conjoint analysis reveal that store attributes of price discount, quality of products offered, variety of assortment, and degree of personalized service, and customer attributes of distance, degree of mobility, and degree of emergency are key determinants of optimal store choice strategies. The primary insight obtained from the agent-based modeling is that the attribute levels of each individual retailer have some effect on other retailers performance. The field-calibrated simulation also evidenced counterintuitive behavior that an increase in unorganized price discounts initially leads to an increase in average footprint at unorganized retailers, but eventually leads to these retailers moving out of the market. Hence, the unorganized retailers should not increase the price discount offered beyond a tipping point or it will be detrimental to them. Another counterintuitive behavior found was that high emergency customers give less importance to variety of assortment than low emergency customers. This study aids in understanding the levers for policy design towards improving the competition dynamics among retail channels in the pharmaceutical retail sector in India.
