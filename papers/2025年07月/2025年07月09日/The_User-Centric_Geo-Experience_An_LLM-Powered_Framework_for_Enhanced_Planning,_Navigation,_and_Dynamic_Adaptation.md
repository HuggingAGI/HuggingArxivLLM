> The User-Centric Geo-Experience: An LLM-Powered Framework for Enhanced Planning, Navigation, and Dynamic Adaptation

# 摘要

> 传统旅行规划系统往往静态分散，难以应对环境变化和行程突变等现实挑战。本文指出现有服务提供商存在三大关键差距：智能行程规划、精准“最后一公里”导航以及动态行程调整，导致用户体验欠佳。我们提出了三个协作智能体：旅行规划代理通过网格化空间定位和地图分析解决复杂多模式查询；目的地助手代理提供精细的最终导航指引；本地发现代理则利用图像嵌入和检索增强生成技术实时检测并响应行程变动。实验结果表明，我们的系统在查询理解、导航精度和抗干扰能力上均有显著提升，展现出其在城市探索到应急响应等场景中的广泛应用前景。

> Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper, we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter" navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications from urban exploration to emergency response.
