> 众所周知，高效探索是深度强化学习中的重要课题，而在多智能体强化学习中，这一问题因算法本身的复杂性而更加突出。为了使多智能体在环境中高效地探索以完成任务，本研究重点探讨了专家探索的概念。具体而言，我们研究了大型语言模型作为专家规划器在基于规划的多智能体任务中实现高效探索的应用。

> Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.
