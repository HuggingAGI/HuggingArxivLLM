# 摘要

> 许多现实世界系统，如交通、生态和互联网系统，都是复杂系统。计算实验作为研究复杂系统的重要工具，能够将这些系统映射到计算机内的可计算和可重复的人工社会模型中，从而为定量分析提供数字化和计算方法。然而，现有研究在构建个体 agent 模型时，往往忽视了代理发展过程中记忆机制的长期累积效应，导致模型与现实系统特征存在一定偏差。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了一种基于记忆-学习协作机制的个体 agent 模型，通过分层建模记忆机制和多指标评估机制，实现了对记忆的有效管理和知识的共享传播。具体而言，通过个体记忆库、群体记忆库和记忆缓冲池的分层建模，可以有效管理记忆，并促进个体与群体之间的知识共享和传播。同时，多指标评估机制能够实现对记忆信息的动态评估，使记忆集合中的信息实现动态更新，并促进记忆与学习之间的协作决策。实验结果表明，与现有记忆建模方法相比，本文提出的模型所构建的 agent 在系统内表现出更好的决策质量和适应性。这验证了本文提出的基于记忆-学习协作机制的个体 agent 模型在提高人工社会建模中个体层面建模质量并实现拟人化特征方面的有效性。

> Many real-world systems, such as transportation systems, ecological systems, and Internet systems, are complex systems. As an important tool for studying complex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society models that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing digital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current research, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the long-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process of agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from the real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning collaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory mechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical modeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and the memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge sharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At the same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic evaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in the memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and learning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory modeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate better decision-making quality and adaptability within the system. This verifies the effectiveness of the individual agent model based on the memory-learning collaboration mechanism proposed in this paper in improving the quality of individual-level modeling in artificial society modeling and achieving anthropomorphic characteristics.
