> REAL: Benchmarking Abilities of Large Language Models for Housing Transactions and Services

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展极大地推动了聊天机器人在多个领域的进步。我们迫切需要评估LLMs是否能够在房地产交易和服务领域发挥与人类相同的作用。为此，我们推出了首个专注于评估LLMs在房地产领域能力的评估套件——房地产交易大型语言模型评估（REAL）。REAL包含5,316个高质量评估条目，涵盖记忆、理解、推理和幻觉4个主题，并细分为14个类别，全面考察LLMs在房地产场景中的知识与能力。此外，REAL还用于评估当前最先进的LLMs。实验结果表明，LLMs在应用于房地产领域时仍存在显著的提升空间。

> The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation (REAL), the first evaluation suite designed to assess the abilities of LLMs in the field of housing transactions and services. REAL comprises 5,316 high-quality evaluation entries across 4 topics: memory, comprehension, reasoning and hallucination. All these entries are organized as 14 categories to assess whether LLMs have the knowledge and ability in housing transactions and services scenario. Additionally, the REAL is used to evaluate the performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate field.
