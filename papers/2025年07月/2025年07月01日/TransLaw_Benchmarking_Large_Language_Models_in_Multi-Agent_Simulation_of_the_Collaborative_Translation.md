> TransLaw: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Multi-Agent Simulation of the Collaborative Translation

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统在机器翻译等应用中表现出色，但在翻译香港法律判决方面仍面临挑战，如复杂法律术语、文化细微差别和严格语言结构。我们推出TransLaw，一个专为香港法律判决翻译设计的多智能体框架。该框架由翻译者、标注者和校对者三个角色协同工作，确保法律意义精准、风格恰当、结构连贯。TransLaw支持定制化模型配置，成本远低于专业人工翻译。我们使用13个开源和商业大型语言模型进行评估，结果显示其在法律语义准确性、结构连贯性和风格忠实性方面超越GPT-4o，但在复杂术语的情境化和风格自然度方面仍需改进。我们的平台可在CityUHK访问，双语判决语料库可在Hugging Face获取。

> Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning, appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure. This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness. Our platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.
