# 摘要

> 人类智能在陌生环境中展现出快速适应与高效解决问题的能力。我们认为，这种适应性源于高效构建与优化环境内部表示的能力，即世界模型，我们将此机制称为世界模型诱导。然而，目前AI领域对世界模型的理解和评估仍局限于从静态数据中学习，忽视了在新环境中通过互动与探索学习表示的效率与效果。本文从认知科学的视角出发，探讨了世界模型诱导的机制，并呼吁建立新的评估框架。我们提出了一种基于“新颖游戏”的新基准测试范式，这些游戏具有真实、深刻且持续更新的创新性。我们明确了构建这些游戏的关键要素，并设计了评估代理快速世界模型诱导能力的指标。我们期待这一框架能激发未来对AI世界模型的评估研究，为开发具备类人快速适应与稳健泛化能力的AI系统——人工通用智能的核心要素——奠定基础。

> Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.
