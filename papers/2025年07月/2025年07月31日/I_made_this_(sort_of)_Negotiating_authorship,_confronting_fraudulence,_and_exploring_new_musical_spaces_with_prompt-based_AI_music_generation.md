> "I made this (sort of)": Negotiating authorship, confronting fraudulence, and exploring new musical spaces with prompt-based AI music generation

# 摘要

> 我回顾了基于先进提示式AI音乐生成平台创作的两张专辑经历。专辑一提出疑问：垃圾邮件与平台的碰撞会产生什么？专辑二则直接回应，并挑战了AI生成音乐无法突破“练习”、“打磨”与“制作”局限的现状。我让大型语言模型（LLM）了解这些专辑并进行采访，由此引发深层思考：我是创作的主导者吗？我在音乐中的位置在哪里？面对才华远超我的机器，我的音乐身份如何演变？我的创作又为音乐开辟了哪些新天地？最后，我通过反思与LLM中介的自我反思，总结了这一创作历程的启示。

> I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and ``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections, as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.
