# 摘要

> 产品线范围界定旨在确定产品线应包含的特征与配置，以满足配置需求。其中关键任务是平衡商业价值与技术实现。传统方法依赖正式特征模型，手动分析耗时费力。本文提出利用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过自然语言交互支持产品线范围界定。我们以智能家居为例，展示LLMs如何评估不同特征模型。最后，探讨LLMs与产品线范围界定结合的开放挑战。

> The idea of product line scoping is to identify the set of features and configurations that a product line should include, i.e., offer for configuration purposes. In this context, a major scoping task is to find a balance between commercial relevance and technical feasibility. Traditional product line scoping approaches rely on formal feature models and require a manual analysis which can be quite time-consuming. In this paper, we sketch how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to support product line scoping tasks with a natural language interaction based scoping process. Using a working example from the smarthome domain, we sketch how LLMs can be applied to evaluate different feature model alternatives. We discuss open research challenges regarding the integration of LLMs with product line scoping.
