> Mind the Gap: The Divergence Between Human and LLM-Generated Tasks

# 摘要

> 人类不断生成各种由内在动机引导的任务。虽然由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的生成式智能体旨在模拟这种复杂行为，但它们是否基于类似的认知原则运作仍不确定。我们进行了一个任务生成实验，比较了人类与LLM智能体（GPT-4o）的反应。发现人类的任务生成始终受到心理驱动因素的影响，包括个人价值观（如开放性）和认知风格。即使这些心理驱动因素被明确提供给LLM，它也无法反映出相应的行为模式。LLM生成的任务明显更少涉及社交、更少涉及身体活动，并且主题上偏向抽象。尽管LLM生成的任务被认为更有趣和新颖，但这凸显了其语言能力与生成人类化、具身化目标的能力之间的脱节。我们得出结论，人类以价值驱动的、具身化认知与LLMs的统计模式之间存在核心差距，强调在设计更符合人类的智能体时，必须纳入内在动机和物理基础。

> Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.
