本文提出了一项创新性研究，旨在探讨结合苏格拉底方法、链式思维推理（CoT）、简化游戏化和形成性反馈的综合方法对大学生数学学习效果的影响，我们将其命名为通过AI大型语言模型进行数学解释（MEGA）。研究表明，许多学生在学习数学时会遇到困难，甚至因此选择避开与数学相关的学科或课程，尽管数学在信号处理等众多领域中具有重要作用。很多时候，这些困难源于传统教学方法的不足。

我们通过随机分配问题并采用组内设计，将MEGA方法与传统的分步（CoT）方法进行了对比研究。参与者为60名大学生，样本分别来自Grade School Math 8K（GSM8K）和Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics（MATH）两个数据集的测试集，基于11%的误差 margin、90%的置信水平以及学生评估员可管理的样本数量进行随机抽取。这些样本用于对两个表现出色的LLM（GPT4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）进行深入评估，这两个模型是从最初测试的六款模型中筛选出来的。

研究结果表明，学生们在更多情况下认为MEGA方法在学习效果上更优。尤其是在更具挑战性的MATH数据集中，MEGA的表现远超传统分步法（47.5% vs. 26.67%），这表明MEGA在解释复杂数学问题方面更具优势。


> This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3) simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students' Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT) method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students. Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.
