> Geometry problem solving is a key area of mathematical reasoning, which is widely involved in many important fields such as education, mathematical ability assessment of artificial intelligence, and multimodal ability assessment. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning technology, especially the rise of multimodal large language models, has triggered a widespread research boom. This paper provides a survey of the applications of deep learning in geometry problem solving, including (i) a comprehensive summary of the relevant tasks in geometry problem solving; (ii) a thorough review of related deep learning methods; (iii) a detailed analysis of evaluation metrics and methods; and (iv) a critical discussion of the current challenges and future directions that can be explored. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and practical reference of deep learning for geometry problem solving to promote further developments in this field. We create a continuously updated list of papers on GitHub: https://github.com/majianz/dl4gps.
