> Theoretical modeling of the dynamic range of an elastic nanobeam under tension with a geometric nonlinearity

# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种描述纳米尺度梁在固有张力下弱非线性与模式相关动力学的理论框架，并深入分析了其在宽广条件范围内的动态特性。动态范围的下限由热运动引起的振动幅度决定，而其上限则由几何非线性显著作用下的大振幅振荡所界定，这种非线性源于拉伸诱发的张力。研究采用固定边界梁、弦模型以及铰接边界梁三种模型对动力学特性进行分析，并对各模型的适用范围进行了详细量化。研究发现，铰接梁模型在宽广的条件下能够提供精确的描述，并且其闭合形式的解析表达具有深刻的见解。研究还确定了弯曲与张力在梁的模式相关动力学中的相对重要性，揭示了弯曲在高频振荡中的重要性，其起始点取决于固有张力的大小。理论预测与两种纳米尺度梁的前十模式的实验测量结果进行了直接对比。我们探讨了这些方法的精度及其在新兴微纳尺度技术中的应用前景，这些技术利用处于线性工作区的小弹性梁的多模式动力学特性。

> A theoretical description of the weakly nonlinear and mode-dependent dynamics of a nanoscale beam that is under intrinsic tension is developed. A full analysis of the dynamic range of the beam over a wide range of conditions is presented. The dynamic range is bounded from below by the amplitude of vibration due to thermal motion and it is bounded from above by large amplitude oscillations where the geometric nonlinearity plays a significant role due to stretching induced tension. The dynamics are analyzed using a beam with clamped boundaries, a string model, and a beam with hinged boundaries. The range of validity for the different models is quantified in detail. A hinged beam model is found to provide an accurate description, with insightful closed-form analytical expressions, over a wide range of conditions. The relative importance of bending and tension in the mode-dependent dynamics of the beam is determined. Bending is shown to be important for the higher modes of oscillation with the onset of its importance dependent upon the amount of intrinsic tension that is present. The theoretical predictions are directly compared with experimental measurements for the first ten modes of two nanoscale beams. We discuss the accuracy of these approaches and their use for the development of emerging micro and nanoscale technologies that exploit the multimodal dynamics of small elastic beams operating in the linear regime.
