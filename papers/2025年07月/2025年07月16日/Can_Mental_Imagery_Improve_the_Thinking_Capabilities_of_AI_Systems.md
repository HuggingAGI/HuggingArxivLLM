> 现有模型虽能与人类互动并提供满意回应，却无法自主行动或独立推理。此外，这些模型的输入数据通常以显式查询形式呈现，即便部分感官数据已获取。AI代理作为能依据编程、数据输入和学习知识自主执行任务和决策的计算实体，已取得显著进展。然而，与人类不同，它们在整合多领域知识方面仍面临挑战。心理图像在大脑的思维过程中扮演基础角色，涉及基于内部多感官数据、计划行动、需求和推理能力来执行任务。本文探讨了如何将心理图像整合到机器思维框架中，以及这如何有助于启动思维过程。我们提出的机器思维框架集成了一个由三个辅助单元支持的认知思维单元：输入数据单元、需求单元和心理图像单元。在此框架内，数据以自然语言句子或绘制的草图形式表示，既提供信息又用于决策。我们为此框架进行了验证测试，结果如下并进行了讨论。

> Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.
