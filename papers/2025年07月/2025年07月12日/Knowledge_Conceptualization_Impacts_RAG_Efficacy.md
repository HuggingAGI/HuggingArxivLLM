# 摘要

> 解释性和可解释性是前沿及下一代AI系统的核心要素，这一点在大型语言模型（LLMs）及生成式AI中尤为突出。与此同时，系统适应新领域的能力同样关键。因此，我们致力于融合这两者，探索设计可迁移且可解释的神经符号AI系统。具体而言，我们专注于“智能体增强生成”系统，这类系统能主动选择、解释并根据自然语言提示查询知识来源。本文系统性地评估了知识结构和复杂性对AI代理查询三元组存储的影响。研究结果显示，两种方法均对结果产生显著影响，我们进一步探讨了这些影响及其意义。

> Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly, generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is, investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss their impact and implications.
