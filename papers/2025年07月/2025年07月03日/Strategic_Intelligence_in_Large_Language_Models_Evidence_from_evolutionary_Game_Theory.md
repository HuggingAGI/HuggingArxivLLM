> Strategic Intelligence in Large Language Models: Evidence from evolutionary Game Theory

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）是否代表了一种全新的战略智能形式？它们能否在竞争环境中推理目标？我们提供了有力的支持证据。迭代囚徒困境（IPD）长期以来一直被用作研究决策过程的模型。我们进行了有史以来首次系列进化IPD锦标赛，将经典策略（如以牙还牙、严厉触发器）与来自OpenAI、Google和Anthropic等顶尖AI公司的智能体进行对战。通过在每场比赛中调整终止概率（即“未来的阴影”），我们引入了复杂性和偶然性，干扰了单纯的记忆策略。我们的结果显示，LLMs极具竞争力，能够在这些复杂的生态系统中持续生存，甚至有时会繁荣发展。此外，它们表现出独特且持久的“战略指纹”：Google的Gemini模型在战略上毫不手软，既会剥削合作对手，也会报复背叛者；而OpenAI的模型则始终高度合作，这一特质在敌对环境中却导致了灾难性后果。Anthropic的Claude则成为最宽容的互惠者，即使在被剥削或成功背叛后，也表现出惊人的意愿恢复合作。通过对模型提供的近32,000篇散文理由进行分析，我们发现它们会主动推理时间范围及其对手的可能策略，并证明这种推理对其决策至关重要。这项研究将经典博弈论与机器心理学相结合，为不确定性下的算法决策提供了丰富而细致的视角。

> Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger) against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the "shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments. Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.
