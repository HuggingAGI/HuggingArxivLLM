# 摘要

> 受语言建模领域突破性进展的启发，近期人们对开发适合分析研究的自回归序列模型产生了浓厚兴趣。本文简短笔记中，我们探讨了统计物理中简单无序动力学玻璃模型的扩展。这些模型具有可调谐的相关性，易于采样，并且在状态空间维度较大时可以精确求解。特别地，我们详细推导了描述其渐近统计特性的动态平均场理论。因此，我们提出这些模型构成了一组有趣的自回归序列生成玩具模型，其中可以研究学习动力学。

> Inspired by striking advances in language modeling, there has recently been much interest in developing autogressive sequence models that are amenable to analytical study. In this short note, we consider extensions of simple disordered kinetic glass models from statistical physics. These models have tunable correlations, are easy to sample, and can be solved exactly when the state space dimension is large. In particular, we give an expository derivation of the dynamical mean field theories that describe their asymptotic statistics. We therefore propose that they constitute an interesting set of toy models for autoregressive sequence generation, in which one might study learning dynamics.
