> Initialization-driven neural generation and training for high-dimensional optimal control and first-order mean field games

# 摘要

> 本文首先提出了一种基于神经网络近似高维最优控制价值函数的方法。通过Pontryagin最大值原理（PMP）与Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman（HJB）方程之间的关系，我们采用神经网络对价值函数进行初步估计，以此作为PMP两点边值问题的初始值，从而生成可靠数据。为训练神经网络，我们定义了一个损失函数，该函数不仅考虑了数据集，还对偏离HJB方程的行为进行惩罚。

    在第二部分，我们结合虚拟玩法算法，提出了一种求解一阶Mean Field Game（MFG）均衡的新方法。这些均衡由HJB方程和连续性方程的耦合系统表征。我们引入第二个神经网络来近似连续性方程的解，该网络通过学习初始代理分布的流映射，并基于从初始分布中采样的初始条件求解基础ODEs生成的数据进行训练。通过整合流近似、价值函数近似方法和虚拟玩法算法，我们成功开发出一种有效解决高维确定性MFG问题的方法。

> This paper first introduces a method to approximate the value function of high-dimensional optimal control by neural networks. Based on the established relationship between Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) and the value function of the optimal control problem, which is characterized as being the unique solution to an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we propose an approach that begins by using neural networks to provide a first rough estimate of the value function, which serves as initialization for solving the two point boundary value problem in the PMP and, as a result, generates reliable data. To train the neural network we define a loss function that takes into account this dataset and also penalizes deviations from the HJB equation.
  In the second part, we address the computation of equilibria in first-order Mean Field Game (MFG) problems by integrating our method with the fictitious play algorithm. These equilibria are characterized by a coupled system of a first-order HJB equation and a continuity equation. To approximate the solution to the continuity equation, we introduce a second neural network that learns the flow map transporting the initial distribution of agents. This network is trained on data generated by solving the underlying ODEs for a batch of initial conditions sampled from the initial distribution of agents. By combining this flow approximation, the previously described method for approximating the value function, and the fictitious play algorithm, we obtain an effective method to tackle high-dimensional deterministic MFGs.
