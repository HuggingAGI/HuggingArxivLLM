> GLOSS: Group of LLMs for Open-Ended Sensemaking of Passive Sensing Data for Health and Wellbeing

# 摘要

> 智能手机和可穿戴设备的普及让研究人员能够利用被动感知数据构建健康与行为预测模型。然而，要全面理解个体行为与情境仍具挑战。被动感知数据的特性使得感知推理需要专业知识与技术能力，这为不同群体设置了门槛。现有系统要么不开放，要么无法进行复杂的数据交叉分析。本文提出了一种新型感知推理系统——面向开放域感知推理的大型语言模型组（GLOSS），它能够进行开放式推理并执行多模态交叉分析。实验显示，GLOSS在准确性和一致性方面（87.93%和66.19%）远超传统检索增强生成（RAG）技术（29.31%和52.85%）。我们通过四个实际案例展示了GLOSS的应用前景，这些案例来自UbiComp和HCI领域的最新研究。最后，我们探讨了GLOSS的潜力、影响及其局限性。

> The ubiquitous presence of smartphones and wearables has enabled researchers to build prediction and detection models for various health and behavior outcomes using passive sensing data from these devices. Achieving a high-level, holistic understanding of an individual's behavior and context, however, remains a significant challenge. Due to the nature of passive sensing data, sensemaking -- the process of interpreting and extracting insights -- requires both domain knowledge and technical expertise, creating barriers for different stakeholders. Existing systems designed to support sensemaking are either not open-ended or cannot perform complex data triangulation. In this paper, we present a novel sensemaking system, Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking (GLOSS), capable of open-ended sensemaking and performing complex multimodal triangulation to derive insights. We demonstrate that GLOSS significantly outperforms the commonly used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, achieving 87.93% accuracy and 66.19% consistency, compared to RAG's 29.31% accuracy and 52.85% consistency. Furthermore, we showcase the promise of GLOSS through four use cases inspired by prior and ongoing work in the UbiComp and HCI communities. Finally, we discuss the potential of GLOSS, its broader implications, and the limitations of our work.
