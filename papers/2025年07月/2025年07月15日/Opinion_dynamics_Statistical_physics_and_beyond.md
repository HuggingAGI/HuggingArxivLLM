> Opinion dynamics: Statistical physics and beyond

# 摘要

> 观点动力学，研究个体信念与集体意见的演变，为将统计物理应用于复杂社会现象提供了沃土。如同物理系统，社会通过局部互动展现宏观规律，如共识或分裂。这一领域蓬勃发展，吸引了跨学科方法，并因大规模行为数据激增而推动。本文综述了该领域的快速发展，整合了分散的文献。我们从核心概念和定义入手，涵盖意见本质、微观与宏观动力学。这一基础为经验研究的概述奠定了基础，从实验室实验到大规模数据分析，为观点动力学模型提供了信息和验证。接着，我们介绍了基于个体的模型，按其宏观现象（如共识、极化、回音室）和微观机制（如同质性、同化）分类。我们还回顾了社会传染现象，强调其与观点动力学的联系。此外，综述涵盖了随机过程、处理方法、模拟和优化等工具。最后，我们探讨了新兴前沿，如连接经验数据与模型，以及利用AI代理测试新社会现象。通过系统化术语并强调与传统物理的类比，本综述整合知识，提供理论基础，塑造观点动力学的未来研究。

> Opinion dynamics, the study of how individual beliefs and collective public opinion evolve, is a fertile domain for applying statistical physics to complex social phenomena. Like physical systems, societies exhibit macroscopic regularities from localized interactions, leading to outcomes such as consensus or fragmentation. This field has grown significantly, attracting interdisciplinary methods and driven by a surge in large-scale behavioral data. This review covers its rapid progress, bridging the literature dispersion. We begin with essential concepts and definitions, encompassing the nature of opinions, microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. This foundation leads to an overview of empirical research, from lab experiments to large-scale data analysis, which informs and validates models of opinion dynamics. We then present individual-based models, categorized by their macroscopic phenomena (e.g., consensus, polarization, echo chambers) and microscopic mechanisms (e.g., homophily, assimilation). We also review social contagion phenomena, highlighting their connection to opinion dynamics. Furthermore, the review covers common analytical and computational tools, including stochastic processes, treatments, simulations, and optimization. Finally, we explore emerging frontiers, such as connecting empirical data to models and using AI agents as testbeds for novel social phenomena. By systematizing terminology and emphasizing analogies with traditional physics, this review aims to consolidate knowledge, provide a robust theoretical foundation, and shape future research in opinion dynamics.
