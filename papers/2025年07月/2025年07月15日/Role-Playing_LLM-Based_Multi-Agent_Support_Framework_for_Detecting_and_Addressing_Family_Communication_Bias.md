# 摘要

> 家庭幸福感中的微妙心理动态常被传统指标忽视，尤其是父母无意识的期望——即理想型父母偏差——对子女情感表达和自主性的压抑。这种源于善意但价值观导向的沟通方式，往往难以被外界察觉或解决。本研究聚焦这些潜在心理动态，探索大型语言模型（LLM）支持下实现心理安全的家庭沟通模式。我们构建了一个包含30种场景的日语亲子对话语料库，每条对话均标注了理想型父母偏差和情感压抑的元数据。基于该语料库，我们开发了一个基于角色扮演的多智能体对话支持框架，能够分析对话并生成反馈。专门的智能体负责检测情感压抑、解析父母话语中的隐含理想型父母偏差，并推断孩子的年龄和背景等情境属性。元智能体将这些输出整合成结构化报告，传递给五位精选专家智能体。这些智能体通过结构化的四步讨论流程，协同生成富有同理心且切实可行的反馈。实验表明，该系统能够以较高准确率识别情感压抑类别，并生成在同理心和实用性方面表现优异的反馈。此外，融入这些反馈的模拟后续对话显示出情感表达和相互理解的改善迹象，这表明该框架在促进家庭互动积极转变方面具有潜力。

> Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that conventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion, often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion, describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality. Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family interactions.
