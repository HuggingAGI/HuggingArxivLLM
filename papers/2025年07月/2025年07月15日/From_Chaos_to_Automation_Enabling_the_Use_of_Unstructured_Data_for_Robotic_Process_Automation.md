> From Chaos to Automation: Enabling the Use of Unstructured Data for Robotic Process Automation

# 摘要

> 企业中非结构化数据的激增给数据分析和流程自动化带来了巨大挑战。非结构化数据，如电子邮件、报告和扫描件，占据了企业数据总量的约80%。尽管这些数据蕴含着大量价值，但提取信息的难度远高于结构化数据。机器人流程自动化（RPA）因其在提高效率和减少错误方面的优势而备受青睐，但传统RPA高度依赖结构化数据，难以处理非结构化文档。本研究开发了UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem（UNDRESS）系统，通过结合模糊正则表达式、自然语言处理技术和大型语言模型，使RPA平台能够高效从非结构化文档中提取信息。研究包括原型系统的开发与基于文本提取和信息检索性能的评估。结果显示，UNDRESS显著提升了RPA处理非结构化数据的能力，为该领域带来了重要突破。这一发现表明，该系统有望推动RPA在传统上受非结构化数据限制的流程中的广泛应用，从而整体提升业务流程效率。

> The growing volume of unstructured data within organizations poses significant challenges for data analysis and process automation. Unstructured data, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as emails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of enterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting meaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to structured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors. However, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its application to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses this limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem (UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural language processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to effectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research involved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent evaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of UNDRESS in enhancing RPA capabilities for unstructured data, providing a significant advancement in the field. The findings suggest that this system could facilitate broader RPA adoption across processes traditionally hindered by unstructured data, thereby improving overall business process efficiency.
