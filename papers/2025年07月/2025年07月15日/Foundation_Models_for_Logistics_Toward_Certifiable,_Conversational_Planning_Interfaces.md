# 摘要

> 物流从业者，无论是战场协调员在风暴前重新规划空运，还是仓库经理应对迟到的卡车，都常常面临需要专业知识和快速重新规划的关键决策。传统整数规划方法虽然能生成满足逻辑约束的计划，但其速度慢且假设理想化的环境模型，忽视了不确定性。而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽能处理不确定性并加速规划，但其易出现误解和幻觉，威胁安全与成本。我们提出了一种结合自然语言对话的神经符号框架，对目标解释提供可验证保证。该框架将用户需求转化为结构化规划规范，量化自身在字段和令牌级别的不确定性，并在置信度低于自适应阈值时启动交互式澄清循环。仅需微调100个不确定性筛选示例的轻量级模型，性能超越GPT-4.1零-shot表现，推理延迟降低近50%。这些结果为实现可认证、实时且用户目标一致的复杂物流决策提供了实用路径。

> Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.
