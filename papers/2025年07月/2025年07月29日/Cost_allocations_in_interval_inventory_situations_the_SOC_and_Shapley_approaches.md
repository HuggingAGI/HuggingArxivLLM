# 摘要

> 需求和供应的不确定性给库存管理带来重大挑战，特别是在协作环境中。传统库存模型，如经济订货量（EOQ）模型，依赖固定参数和确定性假设，难以应对现实场景的复杂性。本文研究了区间库存情境，这是对经典模型的扩展，通过将需求表示为区间来应对不确定性。这种框架使库存决策和成本分摊的分析更加灵活和现实。我们探讨了两种基于区间的分配规则——区间SOC规则和区间夏普利规则，它们旨在公平高效地分配联合订购成本，即便在需求不确定的情况下。我们分析了这些规则的理论特性，并通过案例研究展示了其实际适用性。该研究基于AENA提供的2023年客流量数据，协调了七家西班牙机场的香水库存。研究结果表明，基于区间模型在应对运营不确定性时，能够实现稳健且公平的库存成本分配。

> Uncertainty in demand and supply conditions poses critical challenges to effective inventory management, especially in collaborative environments. Traditional inventory models, such as those based on the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), often rely on fixed parameters and deterministic assumptions, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. This paper focuses on interval inventory situations, an extension of classical models in which demand is represented as intervals to account for uncertainty. This framework allows for a more flexible and realistic analysis of inventory decisions and cost-sharing among cooperating agents. We examine two interval-based allocation rules, the interval SOC-rule and the interval Shapley rule, designed to distribute joint ordering costs fairly and efficiently under uncertain demand. Their theoretical properties are analyzed, and their practical applicability is demonstrated through a case study involving the coordination of perfume inventories across seven Spanish airports, based on 2023 passenger traffic data provided by AENA. The findings highlight the potential of interval-based models to enable a robust and equitable allocation of inventory costs in the face of operational uncertainty.
