# 摘要

> 自动驾驶技术的飞速发展使得车路协同（V2X）通信成为提升感知范围和驾驶安全的关键技术，它能够实现超越视线范围的环境感知。然而，在通信带宽有限和环境动态变化的现实条件下，如何整合来自车辆和基础设施的多源传感器数据仍面临巨大挑战。为了推动这一领域的研究，我们组织了基于V2X协作的端到端自动驾驶挑战赛，涵盖协同时序感知与协同端到端规划两大方向。该挑战赛依托UniV2X框架和V2X-Seq-SPD数据集，吸引了全球30多支队伍参与，并为评估协同驾驶系统设立了统一的基准。本文将介绍此次挑战赛的设计与成果，重点探讨带宽感知融合、鲁棒多智能体规划以及异构传感器集成等关键问题，并分析顶尖解决方案中的技术趋势。通过解决通信与数据融合中的实际约束，此次挑战赛为开发可扩展、可靠的V2X协作自动驾驶系统提供了重要助力。

> With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.
