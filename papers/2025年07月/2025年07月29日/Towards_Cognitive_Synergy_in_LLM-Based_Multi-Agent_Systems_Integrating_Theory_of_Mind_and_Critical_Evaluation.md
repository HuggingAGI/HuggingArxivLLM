近年来，多智能体系统（MAS）因其在开发高效的集体推理能力方面的潜力而备受关注。基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的智能体在独立任务中表现良好，但在需要适应性协作的高阶认知任务中仍面临挑战。人类团队不仅通过知识共享实现协同，还通过递归推理、结构化批判以及推测他人心理状态的能力达成高效协作。然而，当前人工系统缺乏这些关键机制，限制了其在复杂集体推理任务中的表现。

本研究探讨了促进有效协作的认知过程，重点关注适应性心智理论（ToM）和系统性批判性评估。我们围绕三个核心问题展开研究：首先，建模他人视角的能力如何提升协调并减少冗余推理？其次，结构化批判在识别逻辑漏洞和缓解偏见方面如何提升推理质量？第三，这些机制的相互作用如何带来认知协同效应，使系统整体智能超越各部分之和？

通过一个复杂决策的实证案例研究，我们展示了将这些认知机制整合后，智能体之间的交互更加连贯、适应性和严谨。本文为认知科学和人工智能研究领域做出了贡献，提出了一种模拟人类协作推理的MAS结构化框架。它强调了动态ToM和批判性评估在提升多智能体系统应对复杂现实挑战能力中的重要性。

> Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.
