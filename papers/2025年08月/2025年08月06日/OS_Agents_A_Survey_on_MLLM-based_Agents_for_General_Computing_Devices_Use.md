> OS Agents: A Survey on MLLM-based Agents for General Computing Devices Use

# 摘要

> 创造一个像《钢铁侠》中J.A.R.V.I.S那样强大且多才多艺的AI助手，一直是人类的梦想。随着多模态大型语言模型（(M)LLMs）的发展，这一梦想正逐渐成为现实。基于(M)LLM的OS Agents通过计算设备在操作系统提供的环境中运行，实现了任务自动化，并取得了显著进展。本文全面综述了这些先进的OS Agents，从基本原理到构建方法，再到评估与挑战，系统性地梳理了这一领域的研究现状。我们不仅探讨了OS Agents的核心能力，还展望了未来研究的方向。为了让读者更便捷地了解这一领域，我们提供了被ACL 2025接受的9页版本，并维护了一个开源GitHub存储库，以推动进一步的创新。

> The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.
