> Nash Q-Network for Multi-Agent Cybersecurity Simulation

# 摘要

> Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties (namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a steady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this algorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player zero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to learn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in cybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep Q-network (DQN), and the Nash-Q algorithm, addressing common challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent learning. The training process employs distributed data collection and carefully designed neural architectures for both agents and critics.
