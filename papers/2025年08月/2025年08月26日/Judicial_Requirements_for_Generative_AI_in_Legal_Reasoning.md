> Judicial Requirements for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）正融入各专业领域，但在法律这类高风险领域，其局限性尚未得到充分认识。本文明确了人工智能系统要成为司法决策中可靠推理工具所必须具备的核心能力。以IRAC（争议点-规则-适用-结论）模型为分析框架，本研究聚焦法律裁决中最棘手的阶段：确定适用规则（R）与将规则适用于案件事实（A）。从司法视角出发，研究将法律推理拆解为一系列核心要求，包括跨法域选择正确法律框架、基于法律渊源学说构建合理论证、区分判例法中的判决理由与附带意见、化解“合理性”等一般条款引发的模糊性、处理法律条款冲突，以及正确适用举证责任。随后，本文将检索增强生成（RAG）、多智能体系统、神经符号人工智能等多种AI增强机制与这些要求进行匹配，评估它们弥合LLMs的概率性本质与法律解释所需的严谨、选择驱动型推理之间差距的潜力。结果显示，尽管这些技术能应对特定挑战，但仍存在重大难题，尤其是在需要自由裁量权及透明、合理推理的任务中。本文结论认为，当前AI在法律领域最有效的角色是双重的：既是处理大量简单重复性案件的助手，也是人类专家处理复杂事务时的高级“陪练伙伴”。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains, yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood. This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like "reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated "sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.
