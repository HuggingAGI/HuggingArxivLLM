# 摘要

> 本文介绍在研项目SPARC（面向儿童的系统性问题解决与算法推理平台），这是一个专为提升K-12阶段STEM教育中学生参与度和知识 retention 设计的游戏化学习平台。传统教育方法往往难以有效激励学生或促进深度理解，特别是对于复杂的科学概念。SPARC通过将互动式叙事驱动的游戏玩法与基于大型语言模型的人工智能同伴代理相结合，解决了这些挑战。该代理不仅提供答案，还通过对话和探究与学生互动，引导他们合作解释概念和解决问题。平台的设计基于教育理论，并与州级学习标准紧密结合。初步课堂试点采用了多方法评估框架，结合了前测和后测、游戏内分析以及学生和教师的定性反馈。初步结果显示，SPARC显著提升了学生参与度，大多数参与者表示对STEM学科的兴趣增加，后测结果也显示出对概念理解的适度提升。正在进行的开发工作集中在完善AI代理、扩展课程整合以及提高可访问性。这些早期结果展示了将AI驱动的同伴支持与基于游戏的学习相结合，为K-12学习者创建包容、有效且引人入胜的教育体验的潜力。

> This work-in-progress paper presents SPARC (Systematic Problem Solving and Algorithmic Reasoning for Children), a gamified learning platform designed to enhance engagement and knowledge retention in K-12 STEM education. Traditional approaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep understanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses these challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an artificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on refining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving accessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining AI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective, and engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners.
