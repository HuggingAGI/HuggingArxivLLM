# 摘要

> 在金融交易领域，基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理展现出巨大潜力。然而，市场噪声的高敏感性限制了其性能。为突破这一局限，我们提出了一种创新的多代理系统，其内部竞争机制灵感源自现代企业管理体系。该系统由两个专业化团队构成：（1）数据团队——负责处理并浓缩海量市场数据，转化为多样化文本因子，确保符合模型的上下文限制。（2）研究团队——基于深度研究方法，进行并行多路径交易决策。系统的核心创新在于为每个团队内置了实时评估与排名机制，该机制由真实市场反馈驱动。每个代理的表现持续接受评分与排名，仅采纳表现优异代理的输出。该设计使系统能够自适应动态环境，增强对市场噪声的鲁棒性，最终实现更优的交易表现。实验结果表明，相较于现有主流多代理系统和传统量化投资方法，我们的系统在各项评估指标上均表现出显著优势。

> In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.
