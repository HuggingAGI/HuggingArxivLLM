> Normality and the Turing Test

# 摘要

> 本文主张从“常态”概念出发，重新解读图灵测试。其核心观点是：对“常态”的统计解释——即该术语在规范与数学层面均指代“平均值”——至少能从两个角度帮助我们理解图灵测试。首先，图灵测试针对的是常态/平均水平的人类智能，而非卓越智能；要通过测试，就需要造出能“犯错”、表现出不完美行为的机器，就像普通人那样。其次，图灵测试本质上是一种统计测试：智能判断从不由单个“普通”评判者（即非专家）做出，而始终由完整的评审团完成。因此，图灵在其原作中提到的“普通人类询问者”，应主要理解为对多名评判者个体判断进行标准化汇总后形成的数学抽象概念。简言之，本文提出：图灵测试是对“常态智能”的检验，其评估者是“普通评判者”，代表着一群人类询问者的平均判断。本文的结论有两点。其一，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型其实很难通过图灵测试，因为这些模型恰恰以卓越智能为目标，而非常态/平均水平的人类智能。因此，它们应被称为“人工聪明”模型，而非严格意义上的人工智能。其二，图灵测试能否帮助我们理解人类认知，核心问题在于：人类心智是否真的可简化为“常态/平均心智”？这一问题已远超图灵测试本身，甚至对其所属的“常态主义范式”的概念基础提出了质疑。

> This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.
