> From Drone Imagery to Livability Mapping: AI-powered Environment Perception in Rural China

# 摘要

> 随着脱贫攻坚与乡村振兴战略的深入实施，改善农村人居环境、提升生活质量已成为核心任务。农村宜居性正是衡量这些工作成效的核心指标。当前测量方法存在明显局限：问卷法难以推广，面向城市的视觉感知方法也不适用于农村场景。为此，本文提出一种基于无人机影像与多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的农村宜居性专属评估框架。

为全面评估村庄宜居性，研究团队首先通过自上而下的方式，采集了全国146个县1766个村庄的大规模无人机影像。模型框架上，研究设计了高效的图像比对机制：融入二分查找插值法以确定有效图像对，同时减少比对迭代次数。结合专家知识，研究构建了适用于全国农村宜居性测评的思维链提示，兼顾生活质量与生态宜居性维度。这一方法有效提升了宜居性评估的合理性与可靠性。

最后，研究刻画了中国农村宜居性的空间异质性特征，并深入剖析了其影响因素。结果显示：（1）中国农村宜居性呈现“双核-外围”空间格局，以四川、浙江两省为核心向外辐射，呈梯度递减；（2）在各类影响因素中，政府财政支出为核心决定因素，每增加1单位，宜居性相应提升3.9-4.9单位。这些发现为农村建设政策制定提供了重要参考。

> With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146 counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations. Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern, radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients; (2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural construction policy-making.
