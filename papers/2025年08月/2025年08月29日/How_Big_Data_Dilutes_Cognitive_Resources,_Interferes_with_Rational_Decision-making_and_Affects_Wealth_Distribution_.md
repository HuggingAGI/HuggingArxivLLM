> How Big Data Dilutes Cognitive Resources, Interferes with Rational Decision-making and Affects Wealth Distribution ?

# 摘要

> 大数据呈指数级放大了消费需求与速度，但这些都能转化为效用吗？我们探讨了大数据交互场景下CRRA效用函数对消费及效用获取的度量方式，发现其存在缺陷——非理性消费并不能带来效用。我们认为，大数据不同于宏观与微观经济信号，它由一般信息熵构成，会影响经济主体的理性认知，进而导致部分消费无效。我们初步提出了大数据驱动的稀释机制对经济主体认知资源的影响理论。基于理论与实证分析，我们构建了经济主体与大数据交互的消费调整权重函数（CAWF），并将其进一步应用于含金融摩擦的企业财富分配模型。通过平均场博弈（MFG）求解得到解析解后发现：金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富，但也会加剧财富不平等。当经济主体将有效消费（即总消费的一个权重）转化为效用时，企业平均财富会随该权重的增大而增加；同时，财富不平等呈现U型趋势，在权重接近0.5时达到最低值。总之，我们尝试基于经济主体决策中作为禀赋的认知资源，提出一个新的补充假说来完善“卢卡斯批判”。

> Big data has exponentially dilated consumption demand and speed, but can they all be converted to utility? We argue about the measures of consumption and utility acquisition in CRRA utility function under the condition of big data interaction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not lead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is different from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information entropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their consumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution mechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on theoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment Weight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it to a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get analytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower financial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to greater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into utility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms increases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a U-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to 0.5. In conclusion, we try to provide a new complementary hypothesis to refine the 'Lucas Critique' according to the cognitive resources as endowments involved in the decision-making of agents.
