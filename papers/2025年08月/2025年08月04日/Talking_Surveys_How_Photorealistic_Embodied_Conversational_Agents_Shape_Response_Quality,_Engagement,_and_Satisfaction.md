> Talking Surveys: How Photorealistic Embodied Conversational Agents Shape Response Quality, Engagement, and Satisfaction

# 摘要

> 具身对话智能体 (ECAs) 日益逼真，能够进行动态对话。在在线调查中，拟人化智能体通过增强个人参与感和责任感，有助于解决敷衍回答等问题。然而，我们对 ECAs 在用户体验研究中如何影响参与者参与度、满意度和回答质量仍知之甚少。作为概念验证，我们提出了一种工具，使调查能够融入与虚拟化身的对话，利用 AI 驱动的视频生成、语音识别和大型语言模型。在我们的被试间研究中，80 名参与者（英国，一般人口分层随机抽样）要么与带有动画视频化身的语音智能体交谈，要么与聊天机器人互动。基于两项自我报告的心理测量测试，我们获得了 2,265 个对话回复。统计结果比较表明，具身智能体能显著提升回答的信息量和详细程度，同时提高参与度并节省时间。此外，定性分析提供了关于满意度无显著变化的原因的宝贵见解，这些原因与个人偏好、轮流等待时间和恐怖谷效应有关。这些发现支持了开发更接近人类的智能体方法，以将在线调查转变为更自然、更接近面对面访谈的互动方式。

> Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly more realistic and capable of dynamic conversations. In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability. However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions. These findings support the pursuit and development of new methods toward human-like agents for the transformation of online surveys into more natural interactions resembling in-person interviews.
