# 摘要

> 行为金融学为研究外汇市场动态提供了一个极有价值的框架，包括解决过度波动和肥尾分布等难题。然而，当涉及到其与经济的'实际'层面的互动时，现有研究忽视了发展中国家的一个关键特征：它们无法使用本国货币进行贸易，需要美元来获取现代生产技术，并维持与较富裕社会相似的消费模式。

为填补这一空白，我们从发展中国家的角度提出一个新颖的异质性代理模型，该模型将外汇市场区分为投机和非投机部门。我们证明，只要非投机需求对国内经济活动做出反应，就存在一个市场出清的产出增长率。在稳态下，该增长率等于外汇供应增长率与外国资产需求收入弹性的比率，即一个广义的动态贸易乘数。

数值模拟再现了汇率动态和经济增长的关键典型事实，包括偏离典型钟形曲线的分布。来自拉丁美洲国家的数据显示，外汇波动表现出类似的统计特性。此外，我们运用时变参数估计技术，表明动态贸易乘数与这些经济体的实际增长速率密切相关。

> Behavioural finance offers a valuable framework for examining foreign exchange (FX) market dynamics, including puzzles such as excess volatility and fat-tailed distributions. Yet, when it comes to their interaction with the `real' side of the economy, existing scholarship has overlooked a critical feature of developing countries. They cannot trade in their national currencies and need US dollars to access modern production techniques as well as maintain consumption patterns similar to those of wealthier societies. To address this gap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a developing economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative sectors in the FX market. We demonstrate that as long as non-speculative demand responds to domestic economic activity, a market-clearing output growth rate exists that, in steady-state, is equal to the ratio between FX supply growth and the income elasticity of demand for foreign assets, i.e., a generalised dynamic trade-multiplier. Numerical simulations reproduce key stylised facts of exchange rate dynamics and economic growth, including distributions that deviate from the typical bell-shaped curve. Data from a sample of Latin American countries reveal that FX fluctuations exhibit similar statistical properties. Furthermore, we employ time-varying parameter estimation techniques to show that the dynamic trade-multiplier closely tracks observed growth rates in these economies.
