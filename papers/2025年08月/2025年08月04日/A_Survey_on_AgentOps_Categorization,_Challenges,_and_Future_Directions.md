# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的不断提升，基于LLMs的智能体系统在灵活性和可解释性方面超越传统系统，吸引了越来越多的关注。然而，尽管智能体系统在研究和工业应用中备受青睐，但它们和传统系统一样，常常面临异常问题。这些异常导致系统不稳定和不安全，阻碍了进一步发展。因此，亟需一种全面、系统的方法来管理和维护智能体系统。遗憾的是，目前关于智能体系统运营的研究较为匮乏。为填补这一空白，我们开展了一项关于智能体系统运营的调查，旨在为该领域建立清晰框架，明确挑战，并促进进一步发展。具体而言，本文首先系统定义了智能体系统中的异常，分为智能体内部异常和智能体间异常两类。接着，我们引入了一个新颖且全面的智能体系统运营框架，命名为AgentOps，详细阐述了其四个关键阶段：监控、异常检测、根本原因分析和解决方法。

> As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention. However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity, hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed. Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse. To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and resolution.
