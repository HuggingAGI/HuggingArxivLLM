# 摘要

> 现代新闻因其综合性而涵盖了技术、金融、农业等多个领域。然而，这种综合性也带来了理解上的挑战，因为受众往往只具备与其专业知识、年龄或立场相关的知识储备。一个读者可能能完全理解一则新闻的财务影响，却对其中的法律或技术细节感到困惑甚至误解，从而产生关键的理解鸿沟。本研究旨在探讨如何识别这些理解鸿沟并提出解决方案，帮助受众更好地理解新闻内容，特别是在他们专业知识领域之外的文章方面。为此，我们提出了MADES——一个基于智能体的框架，旨在模拟社会沟通。该框架采用了多样化的人工智能体，每个智能体代表特定职业或年龄群体，并配备记忆系统。通过模拟这些智能体对新闻的讨论，我们能够观察和分析它们的行为与认知过程。研究发现，MADES框架能够通过迭代讨论识别新闻内容中的困惑与误解，并据此设计补充材料。统计分析与人工评估均表明，接受补充材料后，智能体对新闻的理解有了显著提升。

> Modern news is often comprehensive, weaving together information from diverse domains, including technology, finance, and agriculture. This very comprehensiveness creates a challenge for interpretation, as audiences typically possess specialized knowledge related to their expertise, age, or standpoint. Consequently, a reader might fully understand the financial implications of a story but fail to grasp or even actively misunderstand its legal or technological dimensions, resulting in critical comprehension gaps. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences' understanding of news content, particularly in the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose MADES, an agent-based framework designed to simulate societal communication. The framework utilizes diverse agents, each configured to represent a specific occupation or age group. Each agent is equipped with a memory system. These agents are then simulated to discuss the news. This process enables us to monitor and analyze their behavior and cognitive processes. Our findings indicate that the framework can identify confusions and misunderstandings within news content through its iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identifications, the framework then designs supplementary material. We validated these outcomes using both statistical analysis and human evaluation, and the results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this supplementary material.
