> A Hybrid Ai Framework For Strategic Patent Portfolio Pruning: Integrating Learning To-Rank And Market Need Analysis For Technology Transfer Optimization

# 摘要

> <翻译失败>

> This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework" that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands (Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and real-world credibility.
