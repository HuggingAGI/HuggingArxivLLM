> We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.
