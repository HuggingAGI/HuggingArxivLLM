# 摘要

> <翻译失败>

> In this work we show how generative tools, which were successfully applied to limit order book data, can be utilized for the task of imitating trading agents. To this end, we propose a modified generative architecture based on the state-space model, and apply it to limit order book data with identified investors. The model is trained on synthetic data, generated from a heterogeneous agent-based model. Finally, we compare model's predicted distribution over different aspects of investors' actions, with the ground truths known from the agent-based model.
