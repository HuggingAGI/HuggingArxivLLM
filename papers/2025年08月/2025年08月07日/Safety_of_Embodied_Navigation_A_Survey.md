# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展推动了具身AI的加速演进，尤其是在导航场景中引发广泛关注。具身导航要求智能体在移动至目标的同时感知、互动并适应未知环境。然而，将其应用于关键场景带来了显著的安全隐患。鉴于其在动态现实环境中的广泛应用，确保系统安全尤为重要。本研究全面剖析了具身导航的安全性，从攻击策略、防御机制到评估方法，多角度展开探讨。除了审视现有安全挑战、缓解技术及评估指标外，我们还聚焦于尚未解决的问题和未来研究方向，涵盖潜在攻击方法、防护策略、评估技术及验证框架。通过填补这些研究空白，本调查旨在为打造更安全可靠的具身导航系统提供宝贵见解，同时对提升社会安全和工业效率具有深远意义。

> As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.
