> CASE: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Scam Intelligence in Digital Payments

# 摘要

> 数字支付平台的蓬勃发展重塑了商业格局，在全球范围内带来了前所未有的便利与普及。然而，这种快速发展也引来了不法分子的觊觎，致使复杂的社会工程诈骗案件随之激增。这些诈骗往往在支付平台之外的多渠道发起并策划，导致基于用户和交易的信号难以全面掌握诈骗手法及潜在规律，从而难以实现及时防范。为此，本文提出了CASE（诈骗阐明对话智能体）——一种全新的智能体AI框架，它通过安全且可扩展的方式收集和管理用户诈骗反馈，从而有效解决这一难题。该框架中的对话智能体经过专门设计，可主动与潜在受害者沟通，通过详细对话挖掘关键情报。随后，对话记录由另一AI系统处理，该系统会提取关键信息并将其转化为结构化数据，供下游自动化及人工执行机制使用。借助谷歌Gemini系列大型语言模型，我们已在印度谷歌支付（GPay）平台部署了该框架。将这些新情报整合到现有功能后，我们发现诈骗拦截量提升了21%。该架构及其完善的评估框架具有极强的通用性，为其他敏感领域构建类似的AI驱动系统、收集和管理诈骗情报提供了可行蓝图。

> The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce, offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally. However, this growth has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in sophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult to prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable manner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed conversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay) India. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence in other sensitive domains.
