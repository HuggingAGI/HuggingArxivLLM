# 摘要

> 传统统计技术与机器学习方法虽为遗传学（尤其是遗传性疾病诊断）贡献卓著，但在处理复杂高维数据时往往力不从心，而这一难题如今已被最先进的深度学习模型攻克。基于Transformer架构的大型语言模型（LLMs）在非结构化医疗数据的语境理解任务中大放异彩。本系统综述聚焦LLMs在罕见病与常见病遗传研究及诊断中的作用。研究团队在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv数据库中开展了基于关键词的自动化检索，重点筛选遗传学领域LLM在诊断与教育中的应用研究，并剔除了无关或过时的模型。通过分析172项研究，重点涵盖基因组变异的识别、注释与解读，以及借助视觉Transformer推动的医学影像技术进步。研究发现，尽管Transformer模型在疾病与风险分层、变异解读、医学影像分析及报告生成方面成效显著，但在多模态数据（基因组序列、影像及临床记录）整合为统一且临床可靠的流程方面，仍面临重大挑战——其泛化能力与临床实际落地应用均存在局限。本综述全面梳理并评估了LLMs在革新遗传性疾病诊断与支持遗传教育方面的现有能力及局限，为该快速演进领域提供了实用的导航参考。

> Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.
