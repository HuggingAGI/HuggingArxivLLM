> Automated Creation of the Legal Knowledge Graph Addressing Legislation on Violence Against Women: Resource, Methodology and Lessons Learned

# 摘要

> 法律决策需要详尽的立法背景知识和最新的法律案例及判决信息。法律知识图谱（KGs）作为促进法律信息获取、支持复杂查询和高级推理的工具，具有重要价值。然而，法律领域中KGs的应用仍较为匮乏。为此，我们开发了一个专注于女性暴力案件的法律KG，并提出了两种互补的自动化构建方法：一种是针对法律领域的系统性自下而上方法，另一种是基于大型语言模型的创新解决方案。通过整合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义增强，这些方法从欧洲法院公开的法律文本出发，构建了专门针对女性暴力案件的法律KG。通过分析和比较两种方法的结果，并采用合适的胜任力问题进行验证，我们发现该KG在提升法律信息获取便利性、支持复杂查询以及为预测性司法提供知识组件方面具有显著潜力。


> Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies. Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches, the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.
