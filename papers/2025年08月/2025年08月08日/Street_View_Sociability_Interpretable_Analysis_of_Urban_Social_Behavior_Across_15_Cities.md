> Street View Sociability: Interpretable Analysis of Urban Social Behavior Across 15 Cities

# 摘要

> 设计社交活跃的街道一直是城市规划的重要目标，然而现有定量研究多关注行人数量，而非社交互动的质量。我们发现，街景图像作为一种低成本且全球覆盖的数据源，蕴含着可以通过社会科学理论提取的潜在社交信息。以Mehta的被动、短暂和持久社交性分类法为指导，我们利用多模态大型语言模型分析了来自15个城市的2,998张街景图像，证实了这一假设。通过线性回归模型，我们控制天气、时间及行人数量等因素，发现推断出的社交性指标与城市层面的地方依恋分数及环境预测因子（如绿色、天空和水景指数）密切相关。研究结果印证了长期的城市规划理论：天空视图指数与所有三种社交性类型相关，绿色视图指数预测持久社交性，而地方依恋与短暂社交性呈正相关。这些发现为街景图像在推断社交互动与建成环境变量关系方面提供了初步证据。未来研究有望将街景图像发展为一种可扩展且保护隐私的工具，用于跨文化理论测试和打造社交活跃城市的证据-based设计。

> Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery -- an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer relationships between specific types of social interactions and built environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant cities.
