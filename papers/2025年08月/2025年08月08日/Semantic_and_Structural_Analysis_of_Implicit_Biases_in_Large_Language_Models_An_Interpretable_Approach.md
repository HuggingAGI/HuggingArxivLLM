> Semantic and Structural Analysis of Implicit Biases in Large Language Models: An Interpretable Approach

# 摘要

> 本文聚焦大型语言模型生成过程中的隐性偏见问题，提出了一种可解释的偏见检测方法。该方法通过嵌套语义表示与上下文对比机制，从模型输出的向量空间结构中提取潜在偏见特征。利用注意力权重扰动分析模型对特定社会属性术语的敏感度，揭示偏见形成的语义路径。实验采用涵盖性别、职业、宗教和种族等多维度的StereoSet数据集，重点评估偏见检测准确率、语义一致性及上下文敏感度等关键指标。结果显示，该方法在多维度下均展现出强大的检测性能，能够准确识别语义相近文本间的偏见差异，同时保持高度语义对齐与输出稳定性。方法在结构设计上具有高度可解释性，有助于揭示语言模型内部的偏见关联机制，为偏见检测提供了更透明可靠的技术基础。该方法特别适用于对生成内容可信度要求较高的实际应用场景。

> This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is required.
