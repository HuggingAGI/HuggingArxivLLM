# 摘要

> 检索增强生成（RAG）已成为缓解大型语言模型（LLMs）局限性的有效方案，可解决幻觉生成、知识过时等问题。然而，中小企业（SMEs）由于资源有限且缺乏自然语言处理（NLP）专业知识，在部署基于RAG的工具时仍面临挑战。本文提出EASI-RAG——面向工业场景的企业级RAG应用支持方案（Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG），这是一种结构化、敏捷的方法，旨在助力工业中小企业快速部署RAG系统。EASI-RAG基于方法工程原则构建，涵盖明确的角色分工、活动流程与技术方法。为验证该方法，研究团队在某环境测试实验室开展了真实案例研究：部署RAG工具，利用从操作流程中提取的数据回答操作员的查询。该系统由一支无RAG经验的团队在不到一个月内部署完成，并后续根据用户反馈进行了迭代优化。结果显示，EASI-RAG支持快速落地、用户采纳率高，能提供准确答案，且提升了基础数据的可靠性。本研究凸显了RAG在工业中小企业中的部署潜力。未来研究将致力于跨更多应用场景的泛化，以及与微调模型的深度集成。

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.
