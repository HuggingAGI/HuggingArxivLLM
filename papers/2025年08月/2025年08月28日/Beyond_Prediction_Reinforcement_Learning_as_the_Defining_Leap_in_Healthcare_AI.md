> Beyond Prediction: Reinforcement Learning as the Defining Leap in Healthcare AI

# 摘要

> 强化学习（RL）为人工智能在医疗健康领域的应用带来了根本性变革。它不再局限于预测结果，而是主动制定具有长期目标的干预方案。传统模型依赖固定关联运行，而RL系统通过试错、反馈和长期奖励优化学习，既带来了变革性机遇，也伴随着新的风险。从信息融合视角出发，医疗健康领域的RL通常通过时间和决策级机制整合多源信号，包括生命体征、实验室检查、临床笔记、影像及设备遥测数据。这些系统可在集中式、联邦式或边缘架构中运行以满足实时临床需求，并自然涵盖数据、特征和决策融合层面。本综述不仅将RL视为一套工具，更将其视为临床环境中向智能体智能转变的标志，探讨其在医疗健康领域的崛起。我们首先结合医疗健康领域的约束条件，梳理RL技术全景，包括基于模型与无模型方法、离线与批量约束方法，以及用于奖励设定和不确定性校准的新兴策略。接着，我们全面分析RL在重症监护、慢性病、心理健康、诊断和机器人辅助等领域的应用，识别其发展趋势、现存差距及转化瓶颈。与以往综述不同，我们深入剖析RL在伦理、部署和奖励设计方面的挑战，并总结安全、与人类对齐的策略学习经验。本文既是技术路线图，也是对RL在医疗健康AI中新兴变革性作用的深刻反思——它并非预测工具，而是智能体临床智能。

> Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes, RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial, feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes, imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms. These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical intelligence.
