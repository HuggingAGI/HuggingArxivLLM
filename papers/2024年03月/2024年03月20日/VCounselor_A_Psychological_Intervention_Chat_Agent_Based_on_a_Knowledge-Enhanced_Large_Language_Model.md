> VCounselor: A Psychological Intervention Chat Agent Based on a Knowledge-Enhanced Large Language Model

# 摘要

> 当前，对话式AI已能与心理困扰的用户展开短暂交流并提供科学依据的心理干预。本研究旨在针对像ChatGPT这类广泛应用的大型语言模型在心理干预领域的局限性，通过构建专精于心理辅导的VCounselor智能代理，提升其在心理干预中的效能和可靠性。为此，我们创新提出了情感互动架构和知识强化架构。为了验证VCounselor的表现，我们选取通用大型语言模型、针对该领域微调过的大型语言模型以及VCounselor搭载的知识增强型大型语言模型进行对比试验，同时也为通用模型和微调模型配备了虚拟形象，以便与VCounselor一同作为代理进行比较。实验结果表明，VCounselor所采用的情感互动和知识强化结构极大地提升了心理干预的效果和信任度，并对用户的情绪产生明显正面影响。综上所述，本研究充分证明了VCounselor凭借相对精准的问题解析能力和专业级的建议输出，在为用户提供心理支持方面展现出了显著的优势。

> Conversational artificial intelligence can already independently engage in brief conversations with clients with psychological problems and provide evidence-based psychological interventions. The main objective of this study is to improve the effectiveness and credibility of the large language model in psychological intervention by creating a specialized agent, the VCounselor, to address the limitations observed in popular large language models such as ChatGPT in domain applications. We achieved this goal by proposing a new affective interaction structure and knowledge-enhancement structure. In order to evaluate VCounselor, this study compared the general large language model, the fine-tuned large language model, and VCounselor's knowledge-enhanced large language model. At the same time, the general large language model and the fine-tuned large language model will also be provided with an avatar to compare them as an agent with VCounselor. The comparison results indicated that the affective interaction structure and knowledge-enhancement structure of VCounselor significantly improved the effectiveness and credibility of the psychological intervention, and VCounselor significantly provided positive tendencies for clients' emotions. The conclusion of this study strongly supports that VConselor has a significant advantage in providing psychological support to clients by being able to analyze the patient's problems with relative accuracy and provide professional-level advice that enhances support for clients.
