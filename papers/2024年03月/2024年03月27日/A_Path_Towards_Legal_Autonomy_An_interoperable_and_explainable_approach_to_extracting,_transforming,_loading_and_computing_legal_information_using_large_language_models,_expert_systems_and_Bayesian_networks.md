> A Path Towards Legal Autonomy: An interoperable and explainable approach to extracting, transforming, loading and computing legal information using large language models, expert systems and Bayesian networks

# 摘要

> 人工智能代理的合法行为，即法律自主性，可以通过两种途径实现。一是对 AI 参与者和资源设定界限，二是限定 AI 对环境影响的范围。后者意味着将 AI 设备的相关法规直接嵌入控制这些设备的软件中，例如在自主无人机的软件中设置操作区域的限制。实现这一点颇具挑战，因为它需要一种能够提取、处理和计算法律信息的方法，这种方法不仅易于解释，还要在法律上通用，并能帮助 AI 进行法律推理。本文尝试利用大型语言模型、法律决策路径和贝叶斯网络，为这种方法提供一个初步的验证。接着，文章探讨了如何将此方法应用于自动驾驶汽车等实际法规，如加州车辆法典。

> Legal autonomy - the lawful activity of artificial intelligence agents - can be achieved in one of two ways. It can be achieved either by imposing constraints on AI actors such as developers, deployers and users, and on AI resources such as data, or by imposing constraints on the range and scope of the impact that AI agents can have on the environment. The latter approach involves encoding extant rules concerning AI driven devices into the software of AI agents controlling those devices (e.g., encoding rules about limitations on zones of operations into the agent software of an autonomous drone device). This is a challenge since the effectivity of such an approach requires a method of extracting, loading, transforming and computing legal information that would be both explainable and legally interoperable, and that would enable AI agents to reason about the law. In this paper, we sketch a proof of principle for such a method using large language models (LLMs), expert legal systems known as legal decision paths, and Bayesian networks. We then show how the proposed method could be applied to extant regulation in matters of autonomous cars, such as the California Vehicle Code.
