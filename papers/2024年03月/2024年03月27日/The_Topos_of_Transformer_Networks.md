> The Topos of Transformer Networks

# 摘要

> 变换器神经网络在大型语言模型的构建中大放异彩，超越了其他所有神经网络架构。本研究通过拓扑理论深入探讨了变换器架构的表现力。我们发现，诸如卷积、递归和图卷积网络等常见架构可嵌入分段线性函数的预拓扑中，而变换器则独占其拓扑完备的空间。这暗示着，传统网络架构属于一阶逻辑，变换器则展现出高阶逻辑推理的能力。研究还与架构搜索和梯度下降相提并论，将分析融入控制论代理的体系之中。

> The transformer neural network has significantly out-shined all other neural network architectures as the engine behind large language models. We provide a theoretical analysis of the expressivity of the transformer architecture through the lens of topos theory. From this viewpoint, we show that many common neural network architectures, such as the convolutional, recurrent and graph convolutional networks, can be embedded in a pretopos of piecewise-linear functions, but that the transformer necessarily lives in its topos completion. In particular, this suggests that the two network families instantiate different fragments of logic: the former are first order, whereas transformers are higher-order reasoners. Furthermore, we draw parallels with architecture search and gradient descent, integrating our analysis in the framework of cybernetic agents.
