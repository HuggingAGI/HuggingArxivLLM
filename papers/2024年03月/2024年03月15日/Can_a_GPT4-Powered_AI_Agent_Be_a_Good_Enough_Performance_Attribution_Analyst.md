# 摘要

> 性能归因分析——深入解读投资组合超越基准表现的背后推动力，是投资组合管理的核心环节，尤其在基金行业对投资决策过程至关重要。基于扎实的金融数学理论基础，其价值与方法已在大量学术文献中得到详尽阐述。近年来，将大型语言模型（LLMs）及AI代理引入这一领域成为一项开创性发展。这些AI代理被设计用于通过精准对比基准自动优化并深化性能归因分析。本次研究展示了一款AI代理如何应用于一系列关键性能归因任务，涵盖业绩驱动因素解析，利用LLMs作为引擎进行多层次归因分析及QA实战演练。借助源自LangChain的标准代理架构及CoT、PS等尖端提示工程技术，研究获得了喜人成果：在剖析业绩驱动因素上的准确度超过了93%，在多层次归因计算中实现了满分，而在模拟官方考试水准的QA测试中也取得了超过84%的准确度。这些发现进一步确认了AI代理及其相关技术和评估在提升投资组合管理效率中的重要作用，并有力彰显了AI技术在该领域的实际运用与评价上取得的重大进步。

> Performance attribution analysis, defined as the process of explaining the drivers of the excess performance of an investment portfolio against a benchmark, stands as a significant aspect of portfolio management and plays a crucial role in the investment decision-making process, particularly within the fund management industry. Rooted in a solid financial and mathematical framework, the importance and methodologies of this analytical technique are extensively documented across numerous academic research papers and books. The integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents marks a groundbreaking development in this field. These agents are designed to automate and enhance the performance attribution analysis by accurately calculating and analyzing portfolio performances against benchmarks. In this study, we introduce the application of an AI Agent for a variety of essential performance attribution tasks, including the analysis of performance drivers and utilizing LLMs as calculation engine for multi-level attribution analysis and question-answer (QA) exercises. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Plan and Solve (PS), and employing a standard agent framework from LangChain, the research achieves promising results: it achieves accuracy rates exceeding 93% in analyzing performance drivers, attains 100% in multi-level attribution calculations, and surpasses 84% accuracy in QA exercises that simulate official examination standards. These findings affirm the impactful role of AI agents, prompt engineering and evaluation in advancing portfolio management processes, highlighting a significant advancement in the practical application and evaluation of AI technologies within the domain.
