# 摘要

> 近期提出的 LLMS 水印技术旨在区分人机创作文本，本文深入探讨了该技术在哲学、政治和伦理层面的影响，并提出一个涵盖机器（LLMs）和人类的作者身份新定义作为讨论的基础。文中论点指出，私有水印技术可能会赋予企业过大的权限来界定作者身份，这与传统的作者认定原则存在冲突。此外，文章进一步探索了水印机制中“熵依赖性”可能带来的问题，认为不同社会关注群体所对应的熵值各异，可能导致机器生成文本的检测率出现群体差异。具体来说，偏好低熵文本的群体可能遭遇其关注内容的机器生成文本更难识别的问题。

> Recently, watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to distinguish text generated by machines and by humans. The present paper explores philosophical, political, and ethical ramifications of implementing and using watermarking schemes. A definition of authorship that includes both machines (LLMs) and humans is proposed to serve as a backdrop. It is argued that private watermarks may provide private companies with sweeping rights to determine authorship, which is incompatible with traditional standards of authorship determination. Then, possible ramifications of the so-called entropy dependence of watermarking mechanisms are explored. It is argued that entropy may vary for different, socially salient groups. This could lead to group dependent rates at which machine generated text is detected. Specifically, groups more interested in low entropy text may face the challenge that it is harder to detect machine generated text that is of interest to them.
