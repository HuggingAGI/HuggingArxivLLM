> Materials science in the era of large language models: a perspective

# 摘要

> LLMs 凭借其令人瞩目的自然语言能力及伴随的各种创新属性，已在复杂代码生成至组合问题求解等多元场景中展现出广泛适用性。本文旨在从材料科学视角探讨LLMs的应用价值，指出其在不同任务和学科中处理模糊需求的能力意味着LLMs有可能成为助力科研的重要工具。我们深入浅出地梳理了LLMs的基本原理，并结合相关文献中的特性与技术进行论述，继而通过两个实际案例展示了LLMs在大规模任务自动化和知识抽取方面的实战效果。现阶段，我们认为LLMs更应该被视作跨领域的高效探索者而非新颖洞见的预言家。我们期待本篇论文能帮助材料科学研究者更好地理解和运用这些工具于自身研究之中。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.
