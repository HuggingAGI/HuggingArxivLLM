> Measuring Meaning Composition in the Human Brain with Composition Scores from Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 意义组合是人类理解句子的核心环节，它涉及到词素、单词等基本单元通过组合构建出短语和句子的含义。尽管神经语言学界深入探究了参与意义组合的大脑区域，但仍缺少一个能有效量化其程度的计算方法。因此，我们借鉴Transformer前馈网络块的关键值记忆解读原理，创新提出了一种名为“Composition Score”的基于模型的度量标准，专用于衡量句子理解过程中意义组合的程度。实验证据显示，此度量标准与大脑中反映词频、结构加工及词语普遍敏感性的区域集群存在关联，揭示了人类句子理解过程中意义组合的多元复杂特性。

> The process of meaning composition, wherein smaller units like morphemes or words combine to form the meaning of phrases and sentences, is essential for human sentence comprehension. Despite extensive neurolinguistic research into the brain regions involved in meaning composition, a computational metric to quantify the extent of composition is still lacking. Drawing on the key-value memory interpretation of transformer feed-forward network blocks, we introduce the Composition Score, a novel model-based metric designed to quantify the degree of meaning composition during sentence comprehension. Experimental findings show that this metric correlates with brain clusters associated with word frequency, structural processing, and general sensitivity to words, suggesting the multifaceted nature of meaning composition during human sentence comprehension.
