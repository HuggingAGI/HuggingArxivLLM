> 近年来，生物医学研究领域面临海量文本数据激增的挑战，这些数据源自科学文献、电子病历、临床试验报告及社交媒体等多元渠道。面对这一难题，生物医学文本挖掘（又称生物医学自然语言处理）应运而生，备受瞩目。社区挑战性评估竞赛有力地推进了该领域的技术创新与跨学科协作，为科研人员搭建平台研发用于生物医学研究中的尖端数据挖掘和信息处理方案。本文聚焦于近期关于中文生物医学文本挖掘的社区挑战赛进展，首先系统梳理了各项评估任务的数据来源和类型；其次，对包括命名实体识别、实体规范化、属性抽取、关系抽取、事件抽取、文本分类、文本相似度计算、知识图谱构建、问题回答、文本生成及大型语言模型评估在内的多个子任务进行了深入总结和对比分析。接着，从转化信息学视角归纳了这些社区挑战任务可能带来的临床应用价值。最后，在肯定其贡献的同时，探讨了这些社区挑战的局限性，并在大型语言模型时代背景下展望了未来的研究方向。

> The field of biomedical research has witnessed a significant increase in the accumulation of vast amounts of textual data from various sources such as scientific literatures, electronic health records, clinical trial reports, and social media. However, manually processing and analyzing these extensive and complex resources is time-consuming and inefficient. To address this challenge, biomedical text mining, also known as biomedical natural language processing, has garnered great attention. Community challenge evaluation competitions have played an important role in promoting technology innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in biomedical text mining research. These challenges provide platforms for researchers to develop state-of-the-art solutions for data mining and information processing in biomedical research. In this article, we review the recent advances in community challenges specific to Chinese biomedical text mining. Firstly, we collect the information of these evaluation tasks, such as data sources and task types. Secondly, we conduct systematic summary and comparative analysis, including named entity recognition, entity normalization, attribute extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, text classification, text similarity, knowledge graph construction, question answering, text generation, and large language model evaluation. Then, we summarize the potential clinical applications of these community challenge tasks from translational informatics perspective. Finally, we discuss the contributions and limitations of these community challenges, while highlighting future directions in the era of large language models.
