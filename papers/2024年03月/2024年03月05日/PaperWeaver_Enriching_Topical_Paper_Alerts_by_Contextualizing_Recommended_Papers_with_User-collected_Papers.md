> PaperWeaver: Enriching Topical Paper Alerts by Contextualizing Recommended Papers with User-collected Papers

# 摘要

> 面对学术资源的爆炸式增长，研究人员依赖于周期推送类似已收藏论文的新发表论文的“论文推荐”服务。但现有系统仅呈现论文标题及摘要，难以让研究者精准把握推荐论文与个人研究情境间的深层关联。为此，我们推出了PaperWeaver——一款丰富化的论文推荐系统，能基于用户已收藏的论文生成推荐论文的上下文化说明。PaperWeaver运用基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算技术，解读用户通过收藏论文所体现的研究兴趣，提炼出论文的特定情境特征，并在此基础上对推荐论文与已收藏论文进行比较分析。一项包含15名参与者的用户研究表明，相较于仅显示推荐论文相关章节的传统方式，使用PaperWeaver的研究者能更准确地理解推荐论文的价值所在，并且在筛选过程中表现出更高的自信度。

> With the rapid growth of scholarly archives, researchers subscribe to "paper alert" systems that periodically provide them with recommendations of recently published papers that are similar to previously collected papers. However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users' research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.
