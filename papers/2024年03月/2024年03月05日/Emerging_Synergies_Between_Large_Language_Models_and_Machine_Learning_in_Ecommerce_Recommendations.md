> Emerging Synergies Between Large Language Models and Machine Learning in Ecommerce Recommendations

# 摘要

> 随着电商和Web应用的繁荣，推荐系统凭借为用户提供个性化推荐而深深植根于我们的日常生活中。虽然深度神经网络(DNNs)通过模拟用户与商品间的互动关系，并结合文本信息，在提升推荐系统效果方面成果斐然，但此类DNN方案在准确理解用户兴趣和捕捉文本信息方面仍有局限，且难以应对不同场景下的推荐问题和预测解释。此刻，以ChatGPT和GPT-4为代表的大型语言模型(LLMs)以其在语言理解和生成上的强大性能，以及出色的泛化和推理能力，正在深刻改变着NLP和AI领域。因此，近期的研究正积极探索运用LLM力量优化推荐系统的新途径。面对推荐系统研究中LLM驱动方法的快速发展趋势，亟需对相关领域的研究者和从业者提供一个系统的综述，以便深入了解现有LLM驱动的推荐系统。我们将首先介绍一种利用LLM作为特征编码器构建用户和商品表征的典型方法，进而从预训练、微调和提示三个维度审视LLMs技术在强化协同过滤推荐系统方面的前沿进展，最后全方位展望这一新兴领域未来的研究方向。

> With the boom of e-commerce and web applications, recommender systems have become an important part of our daily lives, providing personalized recommendations based on the user's preferences. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress in improving recommendation systems by simulating the interaction between users and items and incorporating their textual information, these DNN-based approaches still have some limitations, such as the difficulty of effectively understanding users' interests and capturing textual information. It is not possible to generalize to different seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reason about their predictions. At the same time, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to their superior capabilities in the basic tasks of language understanding and generation, and their impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent research has sought to harness the power of LLM to improve recommendation systems. Given the rapid development of this research direction in the field of recommendation systems, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of existing LLM-driven recommendation systems for researchers and practitioners in related fields to gain insight into. More specifically, we first introduced a representative approach to learning user and item representations using LLM as a feature encoder. We then reviewed the latest advances in LLMs techniques for collaborative filtering enhanced recommendation systems from the three paradigms of pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we had a comprehensive discussion on the future direction of this emerging field.
