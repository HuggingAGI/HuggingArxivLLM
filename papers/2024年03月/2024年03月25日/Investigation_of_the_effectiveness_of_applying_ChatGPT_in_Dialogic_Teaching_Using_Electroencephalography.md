> Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography

# 摘要

> 近年来，以ChatGPT为代表的大型语言模型迅速崛起，展现出在教育领域的广泛应用潜力，它们能够解析知识、答疑解惑并根据情境互动，有力支持了对话式教学的发展。一项有价值的研究聚焦于此类模型能否有效扮演教学角色，仿效真人教师在对话教学中促进学生学习。研究选取了34位大学生作为参与者，随机分为两组，实验组借助ChatGPT进行对话式教学，而对照组则与真人口头交流，共同学习“数字图像处理”课程中的直方图均衡化内容。期末保持测试结果显示，两组学生成绩相当；而在知识迁移测试中，与ChatGPT对话的学生表现略逊一筹。脑电波监测显示，与ChatGPT互动的学生认知活跃度更高，意味着ChatGPT有助于构建知识框架并激发思维活力。不过，它在提升学生知识应用及创新能力上的作用并不突出。综上所述，ChatGPT尚无法在信息相关课程的对话式教学中独立完成全部教学任务，而将ChatGPT与传统真人教师相结合或许是一种更为理想的解决方案，两者相辅相成，能为学生提供更加全面的学习支持，从而整体提升教学质量。

> In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.
