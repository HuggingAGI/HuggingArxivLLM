> 鉴于大型语言模型展现出了类人般的逻辑思维和理解力，探究其是否能模拟真实用户交互行为以搭建可信的虚拟推荐A/B测试环境，进而推动推荐研究的实际应用，是一个迫切而重要的经济价值问题。借助交互设计与机器学习的联姻，产品与服务能提供更为高效且个性化的用户体验，这类定制化服务恰好能满足用户的独特需求，提升用户满意度和忠诚度。此外，通过优质用户界面和互动体验，交互系统得以洞悉用户对产品的看法和需求，并利用机器学习算法不断优化产品。这个迭代优化的过程确保了产品品质与性能与时俱进，以应对用户日益变化的需求。同时，设计者还需思考如何巧妙地将各类算法与工具融入交互系统，营造优质的用户体验。本文旨在深挖大型语言模型、机器学习以及交互设计在推荐系统和操作系统中对于用户交互的潜在应用潜力，通过整合这些先进技术手段，我们可以打造出更智能、更具个性化的服务方案，满足用户需求并有力驱动产品不断改良与优化，这无论对于推荐研究领域还是用户体验实践均意义重大。

> With the large language model showing human-like logical reasoning and understanding ability, whether agents based on the large language model can simulate the interaction behavior of real users, so as to build a reliable virtual recommendation A/B test scene to help the application of recommendation research is an urgent, important and economic value problem. The combination of interaction design and machine learning can provide a more efficient and personalized user experience for products and services. This personalized service can meet the specific needs of users and improve user satisfaction and loyalty. Second, the interactive system can understand the user's views and needs for the product by providing a good user interface and interactive experience, and then use machine learning algorithms to improve and optimize the product. This iterative optimization process can continuously improve the quality and performance of the product to meet the changing needs of users. At the same time, designers need to consider how these algorithms and tools can be combined with interactive systems to provide a good user experience. This paper explores the potential applications of large language models, machine learning and interaction design for user interaction in recommendation systems and operating systems. By integrating these technologies, more intelligent and personalized services can be provided to meet user needs and promote continuous improvement and optimization of products. This is of great value for both recommendation research and user experience applications.
