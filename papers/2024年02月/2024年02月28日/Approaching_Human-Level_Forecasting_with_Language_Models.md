# 摘要

> 预测未来事件是决策与政策制定的关键所在，为此，我们探索语言模型（LMs）能否媲美竞赛级人类预测者的预测能力。本研究构建了一套具备自动检索相关信息、生成预测及整合预测功能的检索增强型 LM 系统。为检验这一系统，我们从多个竞争性预测平台收集了大量的问题数据集。在一个设定在 LM 知识更新后的测试集上，我们将系统端到端的表现与人类预测的整体集合进行比较。结果显示，该系统整体上接近甚至在特定场景下超越了竞赛级预测人群的综合预测水平。这意味着运用 LMs 进行未来预测有望实现大规模精准预测，有力辅助各类机构的决策制定。

> Forecasting future events is important for policy and decision making. In this work, we study whether language models (LMs) can forecast at the level of competitive human forecasters. Towards this goal, we develop a retrieval-augmented LM system designed to automatically search for relevant information, generate forecasts, and aggregate predictions. To facilitate our study, we collect a large dataset of questions from competitive forecasting platforms. Under a test set published after the knowledge cut-offs of our LMs, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of our system against the aggregates of human forecasts. On average, the system nears the crowd aggregate of competitive forecasters, and in some settings surpasses it. Our work suggests that using LMs to forecast the future could provide accurate predictions at scale and help to inform institutional decision making.
