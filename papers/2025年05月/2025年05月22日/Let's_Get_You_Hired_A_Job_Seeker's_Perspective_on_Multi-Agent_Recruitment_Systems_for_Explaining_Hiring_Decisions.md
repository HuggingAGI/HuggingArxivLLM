> Let's Get You Hired: A Job Seeker's Perspective on Multi-Agent Recruitment Systems for Explaining Hiring Decisions

# 摘要

> 在招聘过程中，传统候选人筛选方法普遍存在缺乏透明度的问题。无论是由人工招聘人员手动决策，还是通过基于黑箱的申请人跟踪系统（ATS）做出决定，候选人很少能获得充分的招聘决策理由。为了解决这一问题，我们开发了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的多智能体AI系统，旨在为求职者提供招聘过程中的指导。我们采用迭代式用户中心设计方法，首先开展了一个两阶段的探索性研究，邀请四位活跃求职者参与，为系统设计和开发提供依据。随后，我们通过一对一访谈，对20位活跃求职者进行了深入的定性用户研究，以评估开发的原型系统。评估结果显示，与传统方法相比，参与者认为我们的多智能体招聘系统在行动性、可信度和公平性方面显著更优。我们的研究进一步揭示了影响这些感知用户体验的因素，并为构建跨领域用户对齐的多智能体可解释AI系统提供了设计启示。


> During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack transparency. Candidates are rarely given sufficient justifications for recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide job seekers during the recruitment process. Using an iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly more actionable, trustworthy, and fair compared to traditional methods. Our study further helped us uncover in-depth insights into factors contributing to these perceived user experiences. Drawing from these insights, we offer broader design implications for building user-aligned, multi-agent explainable AI systems across diverse domains.
