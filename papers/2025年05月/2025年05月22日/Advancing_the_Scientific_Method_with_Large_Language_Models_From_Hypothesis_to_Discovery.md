> Advancing the Scientific Method with Large Language Models: From Hypothesis to Discovery

# 摘要

> 近期诺贝尔奖的认可，标志着人工智能（AI）在科学领域的贡献得到了正式肯定。大型语言模型（LLMs）正在通过提升生产力和重新定义科学方法，深刻改变科学研究的方式。目前，LLMs已广泛应用于实验设计、数据分析及工作流优化，尤其在化学和生物学领域表现突出。然而，生成错误信息和可靠性不足等问题依然存在。本文将探讨大型语言模型如何重新定义科学研究方法，并深入分析其在科学周期各阶段的潜在应用场景，从假设验证到新发现的全过程。我们得出结论：要使LLMs成为富有创造力且高效的生产力工具，必须将其深度融入科学研究的每一个环节，同时确保与人类科学目标保持一致，建立明确的评估标准。向AI驱动的科学研究转型，引发了关于创造、监督和责任的伦理思考。通过精心引导，LLMs有望成为推动跨学科突破的创意引擎，负责任且有效地促进科学进步。然而，科学界也需审慎决定将多大程度的科研自主权赋予LLMs，即便在与'推理'能力相关联（尽管目前这一能力仍待完善）的情况下，也要权衡其探索未知假设和解决方案的潜力，这些可能是人类研究难以触及的领域。

> With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity, oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise remain unexplored by human exploration alone.
