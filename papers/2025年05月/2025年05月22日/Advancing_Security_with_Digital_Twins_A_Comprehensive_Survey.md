> Advancing Security with Digital Twins: A Comprehensive Survey

# 摘要

> 电子设备的普及正在深刻改变人类生活的方方面面，从通信到医疗，从交通到能源。然而，由于电子产品的复杂性和固有漏洞，全球电子供应链面临着多种威胁，包括知识产权盗版、篡改、伪造、信息泄露、侧信道攻击和故障注入攻击。尽管已有诸多解决方案提出，但在应对新兴攻击的可扩展性和全面防护方面仍存明显空白。数字孪生作为物理系统的动态虚拟副本，凭借其追溯能力、端到端可见性和持续完整性验证，成为解决这些难题的有力工具。本文基于数字孪生的功能角色和应用领域，全面综述其在安全领域的应用，涵盖网络物理系统、物联网、密码系统、假冒电子设备检测、入侵检测、故障注入和侧信道泄露等多个方面。据我们所知，这是首次将这些安全用例整合到一个统一参考框架中。此外，本文还探讨了将大型语言模型与数字孪生相结合以提升安全性的方法，并深入分析了当前挑战、解决方案及未来研究方向。

> The proliferation of electronic devices has greatly transformed every aspect of human life, such as communication, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Unfortunately, the global electronics supply chain is vulnerable to various attacks, including piracy of intellectual properties, tampering, counterfeiting, information leakage, side-channel, and fault injection attacks, due to the complex nature of electronic products and vulnerabilities present in them. Although numerous solutions have been proposed to address these threats, significant gaps remain, particularly in providing scalable and comprehensive protection against emerging attacks. Digital twin, a dynamic virtual replica of a physical system, has emerged as a promising solution to address these issues by providing backward traceability, end-to-end visibility, and continuous verification of component integrity and behavior. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the application of digital twins based on their functional role and application domains. We comprehensively present recent digital twin-based security implementations, including their role in cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, and cryptographic systems, detection of counterfeit electronics, intrusion detection, fault injection, and side-channel leakage. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to consolidate these security use cases into a unified reference. The paper also explores the integration of large language models with digital twins for enhanced security and discusses current challenges, solutions, and future research directions.
