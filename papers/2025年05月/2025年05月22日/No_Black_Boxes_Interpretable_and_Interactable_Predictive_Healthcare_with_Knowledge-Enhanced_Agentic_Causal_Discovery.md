> No Black Boxes: Interpretable and Interactable Predictive Healthcare with Knowledge-Enhanced Agentic Causal Discovery

# 摘要

> 基于大量电子健康记录（EHR）数据训练的深度学习模型在诊断预测方面表现出色，为临床医生提供决策支持。然而，这些模型的黑箱特性使其难以被临床医生理解和应用。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了II-KEA框架，通过整合个性化知识库和智能体大型语言模型，提升了模型的可解释性和交互性。II-KEA不仅通过显式推理和因果分析增强了可解释性，还通过定制知识库和提示机制，让临床医生能够将自身知识和经验融入决策过程。在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的评估结果表明，II-KEA在保持高性能的同时，显著提升了可解释性和交互性，这一点得到了大量案例研究的支持。

> Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR) data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning. However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value: interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.
