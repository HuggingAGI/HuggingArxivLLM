> A Fully Generative Motivational Interviewing Counsellor Chatbot for Moving Smokers Towards the Decision to Quit

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLMs) 的对话能力暗示它们可成为自动化的谈话治疗工具。了解这些系统的效果及是否符合治疗标准至关重要。我们开发了一款专注于激励吸烟者戒烟的辅导员聊天机器人。该机器人基于先进 LLM，采用广泛应用的动机访谈法 (MI)，并由 MI 专家临床科学家协助开发。我们还介绍了对聊天机器人遵循 MI 标准及客户反应的自动化评估，并进行了验证。测试显示，106 名参与者在对话后一周内对自己戒烟成功的信心提升了 1.7 分（0-10 分制）。自动化评估表明，聊天机器人在 98% 的交流中符合 MI 标准，优于人类辅导员。尽管在感知共情方面略低于人类，但聊天机器人仍表现出色。此外，参与者语言显示他们有较高戒烟动机，这正是 MI 的核心目标。这些结果表明，利用现代 LLM 实现谈话治疗自动化具有巨大潜力。

> The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.
