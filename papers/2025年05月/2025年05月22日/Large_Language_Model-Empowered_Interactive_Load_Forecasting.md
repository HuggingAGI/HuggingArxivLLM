# 摘要

> 电力系统的日益复杂性使得准确的负荷预测变得至关重要。近年来，尽管先进的负荷预测方法层出不穷，但现有方法的静态设计缺乏人模交互机制。作为预测模型的主要使用者，系统操作员往往难以理解和应用这些需要人工智能专业知识的高级模型，也无法将自身经验和现实情境理解融入预测过程。得益于大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新突破，我们提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体协作框架，旨在弥合人机操作员与预测模型之间的鸿沟。通过设计一组智能体在预测工作流中各司其职并协同合作，该框架在负荷预测过程中嵌入了交互机制，降低了非专家用户的使用门槛，同时实现了人类经验的有效整合。实验表明，用户在关键阶段提供专业见解可显著提升交互式负荷预测的准确性。成本分析显示，该框架经济实惠，具备实际应用价值。

> The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism. This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.
