本文通过对现有人类-人类协作写作理论和框架的批判性回顾，评估其在专业领域中对当前人类-AI协作范式的适用性，并提炼出七项关键见解及对人类-AI协作写作工具的设计启示。研究发现，随着LLMs将写作过程转变为一种类似于原型设计的“试错”模式，写作的非线性认知过程虽保持不变，但对修订方法的要求将更加严格。这一转变不仅凸显了连贯性支持的重要性，还为长期存在的写作挑战提供了全新的解决方案——得益于LLM前所未有的语义能力。然而，我们主张，人类-人类协作写作中备受关注的团队因素（如群体意识、共识构建和作者身份）不应直接套用到人类-AI协作场景，因过度拟人化可能引发偏差。如今，随着LLM的文本生成能力几乎与人类写作无异，我们正迈入一个历史性的新时代：每天在工作中与AI进行协作写作。本文旨在为人类-AI协作写作的交互设计提供坚实的理论基础和实用的设计指导，助力未来更高效、更智能的写作软件开发。

> In this paper, we conduct a critical review of existing theories and frameworks on human-human collaborative writing to assess their relevance to the current human-AI paradigm in professional contexts, and draw seven insights along with design implications for human-AI collaborative writing tools. We found that, as LLMs nudge the writing process more towards an empirical "trial and error" process analogous to prototyping, the non-linear cognitive process of writing will stay the same, but more rigor will be required for revision methodologies. This shift would shed further light on the importance of coherence support, but the large language model (LLM)'s unprecedented semantic capabilities can bring novel approaches to this ongoing challenge. We argue that teamwork-related factors such as group awareness, consensus building and authorship - which have been central in human-human collaborative writing studies - should not apply to the human-AI paradigm due to excessive anthropomorphism. With the LLM's text generation capabilities becoming essentially indistinguishable from human-written ones, we are entering an era where, for the first time in the history of computing, we are engaging in collaborative writing with AI at workplaces on a daily basis. We aim to bring theoretical grounding and practical design guidance to the interaction designs of human-AI collaborative writing, with the goal of enhancing future human-AI writing software.
