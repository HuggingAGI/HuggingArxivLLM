> A Day in Their Shoes: Using LLM-Based Perspective-Taking Interactive Fiction to Reduce Stigma Toward Dirty Work

# 摘要

> “肮脏工作”常因根深蒂固的社会污名而备受争议，这不仅损害从业者心理健康，也阻碍了职业公平。本研究提出了一种由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的互动小说（IF）框架，旨在通过增强同理心来减少对这些关键却受污名化职业的偏见。实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了参与者对这些职业的理解，激发了高度共情，并建立了与从业者的情感联结。进一步的访谈揭示，基于LLM的互动小说不仅增强了沉浸感，还加深了参与者对“肮脏工作”的情感共鸣和职业认同感。然而，研究也发现了一些挑战，如LLM生成内容的局限性以及潜在的刻板印象强化问题。总体而言，本研究证实了基于LLM的同理心互动小说框架在促进职业公平和消除职业污名方面具有广阔的应用前景。

> Occupations referred to as "dirty work" often face entrenched social stigma, which adversely affects the mental health of workers in these fields and impedes occupational equity. In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants' understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward "dirty work," and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.
