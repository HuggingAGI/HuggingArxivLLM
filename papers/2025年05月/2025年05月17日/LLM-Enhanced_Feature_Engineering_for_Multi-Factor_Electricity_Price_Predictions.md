# 摘要

> 准确预测电价波动对有效管理和决策至关重要。然而，传统模型往往难以捕捉电力市场中的复杂动态，尤其是面对天气和市场波动等外部因素时表现不足。在新南威尔士州等高波动性市场中，这些局限性尤为明显。为此，我们提出了FAEP框架，通过结合大型语言模型与先进特征工程，显著提升了预测准确性。FAEP整合了天气数据和价格波动等外部特征，并借助检索增强生成技术进行有效特征提取。此外，FAEP采用混合XGBoost-LSTM模型优化特征，构建了更稳健的预测系统。实验结果表明，在澳大利亚新南威尔士州电力市场中，FAEP超越现有模型，达到最先进水平，充分证明了LLM增强特征工程与混合架构的优势。

> Accurately forecasting electricity price volatility is crucial for effective risk management and decision-making. Traditional forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex, non-linear dynamics of electricity markets, particularly when external factors like weather conditions and market volatility are involved. These limitations hinder their ability to provide reliable predictions in markets with high volatility, such as the New South Wales (NSW) electricity market. To address these challenges, we introduce FAEP, a Feature-Augmented Electricity Price Prediction framework. FAEP leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with advanced feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy. By incorporating external features such as weather data and price volatility jumps, and utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for effective feature extraction, FAEP overcomes the shortcomings of traditional approaches. A hybrid XGBoost-LSTM model in FAEP further refines these augmented features, resulting in a more robust prediction framework. Experimental results demonstrate that FAEP achieves state-of-art (SOTA) performance compared to other electricity price prediction models in the Australian New South Wale electricity market, showcasing the efficiency of LLM-enhanced feature engineering and hybrid machine learning architectures.
