> Examining Linguistic Shifts in Academic Writing Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT: A Study on Preprint Papers

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，引发了学术界对其对学术写作影响的担忧。现有研究主要通过定量方法，如词频统计和基于概率的分析，探讨了LLMs在学术写作中的使用情况。然而，很少有研究系统地考察LLMs对学术写作语言特征的潜在影响。为填补这一空白，我们对来自arXiv数据集的过去十年发表的823,798篇摘要进行了大规模分析。

通过分析LLM偏好词的频率、词汇复杂度、句法复杂度、连贯性、可读性和情感等语言特征，研究发现摘要中LLM偏好词的比例显著增加，揭示了LLMs对学术写作的广泛影响。此外，我们观察到摘要中词汇复杂度和情感的增加，但句法复杂度的降低，表明LLMs引入了更多新词汇并简化了句式结构。然而，连贯性和可读性的显著下降表明摘要中连接词减少，阅读难度加大。

此外，我们的分析表明，英语能力较弱的学者更有可能使用LLMs进行学术写作，并注重提高摘要的整体逻辑和流畅度。最后，在学科层面，我们发现计算机科学领域的学者在写作风格上的变化更为显著，而数学领域的变化则较小。

> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses. However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity, cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in Mathematics were minimal.
