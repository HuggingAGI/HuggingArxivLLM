# 摘要

> 大型语言模型正在改变各行各业。它们不仅具备强大的推理能力，还在解决复杂问题上表现卓越，这一点从其在编码和数学测试中的优异成绩中可见一斑。然而，面对汽车行业等现实挑战，现有的模型是否真正胜任？它们能否准确理解高层次的抽象指令？是能够直接将其转化为代码，还是仍需人工协助？本研究选取了当前最先进的模型进行测试，评估其将汽车行业的标准和文档中的抽象需求转化为CARLA仿真配置代码的能力。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking many industries by storm. They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.
