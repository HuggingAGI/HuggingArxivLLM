5G网络规划中的基站选址是一项关键挑战，需要高效优化覆盖、成本、用户满意度及实际约束。传统人工方法依赖专业知识，效率低下且难以实现满意的一致性。现有AI工具虽在某些方面提升效率，仍难以满足电信网络的动态条件和多目标需求。为此，我们提出了TelePlanNet——专为基站选址设计的AI驱动框架，通过三层架构实现高效规划与大规模自动化。TelePlanNet结合大型语言模型实时处理用户输入与基站规划意图对齐，并采用改进的组相对策略优化（GRPO）强化学习训练规划模型，有效解决多目标优化问题，评估候选站点并提供实用方案。实验表明，TelePlanNet将规划一致性提升至78%，优于传统方法，为运营商提供高效可扩展工具，显著推动蜂窝网络规划发展。


> The selection of base station sites is a critical challenge in 5G network planning, which requires efficient optimization of coverage, cost, user satisfaction, and practical constraints. Traditional manual methods, reliant on human expertise, suffer from inefficiencies and are limited to an unsatisfied planning-construction consistency. Existing AI tools, despite improving efficiency in certain aspects, still struggle to meet the dynamic network conditions and multi-objective needs of telecom operators' networks. To address these challenges, we propose TelePlanNet, an AI-driven framework tailored for the selection of base station sites, integrating a three-layer architecture for efficient planning and large-scale automation. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for real-time user input processing and intent alignment with base station planning, combined with training the planning model using the improved group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, the proposed TelePlanNet can effectively address multi-objective optimization, evaluates candidate sites, and delivers practical solutions. Experiments results show that the proposed TelePlanNet can improve the consistency to 78%, which is superior to the manual methods, providing telecom operators with an efficient and scalable tool that significantly advances cellular network planning.
