> Simulation Agent: A Framework for Integrating Simulation and Large Language Models for Enhanced Decision-Making

# 摘要

> 仿真模拟虽然擅长精准复制现实系统，但复杂的特性常常让非技术人员望而却步。大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然以直观的语言交互见长，但在理解和模拟复杂现实动态方面仍有不足。我们推出的仿真代理框架巧妙融合了仿真模型与LLMs的各自优势。通过借助LLMs的对话能力，用户能够轻松与复杂仿真系统互动，同时仿真系统为LLMs提供现实世界现象的准确结构化表达。这种创新方法不仅为实证验证奠定了坚实基础，更在多个领域展现出广泛的应用前景。

> Simulations, although powerful in accurately replicating real-world systems, often remain inaccessible to non-technical users due to their complexity. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) provide intuitive, language-based interactions but can lack the structured, causal understanding required to reliably model complex real-world dynamics. We introduce our simulation agent framework, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both simulation models and LLMs. This framework helps empower users by leveraging the conversational capabilities of LLMs to interact seamlessly with sophisticated simulation systems, while simultaneously utilizing the simulations to ground the LLMs in accurate and structured representations of real-world phenomena. This integrated approach helps provide a robust and generalizable foundation for empirical validation and offers broad applicability across diverse domains.
