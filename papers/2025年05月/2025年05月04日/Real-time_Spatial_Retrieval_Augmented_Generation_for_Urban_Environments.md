> Real-time Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Urban Environments

# 摘要

> 生成式AI，尤其是大型语言模型的蓬勃发展，为城市应用带来了革命性的机遇，通过城市基础模型实现这一目标。然而，基础模型存在局限性，因为它们仅包含训练时可用的知识，更新它们既耗时又昂贵。检索增强生成（RAG）作为一种向基础模型注入上下文信息的首选方法在文献中出现。与微调等技术相比，RAG在动态、实时场景中更为有效，例如城市环境中。然而，基于语义数据库、知识图谱、结构化数据或AI驱动网络搜索的传统RAG架构并未完全满足城市环境的需求。城市环境是复杂系统，其特点在于大量相互关联的数据、频繁更新、实时处理需求、安全要求以及与物理世界的紧密联系。本研究提出了一种实时空间RAG架构，定义了将生成式AI有效融入城市所需的关键组件，通过链式数据利用时空过滤功能。该架构基于FIWARE生态系统实现，这是一个用于开发智慧城市解决方案和数字孪生的软件组件集合。设计和实现通过马德里市的旅游助手用例得以展示。该用例验证了通过提出的RAG架构正确整合基础模型的能力。

> The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.
