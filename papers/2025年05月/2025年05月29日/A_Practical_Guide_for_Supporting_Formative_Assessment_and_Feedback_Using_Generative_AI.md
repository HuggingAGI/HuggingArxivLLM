# 摘要

> 形成性评估是教学与学习的核心，为学生提供学习指引。尽管生成式AI在自动问题生成、智能辅导系统及个性化反馈等形成性评估的多个领域得到了广泛应用，但对其核心教学原则的研究仍显不足。本文深入探讨了生成式AI，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT，如何助力形成性评估的三大关键环节：帮助学生、教师及同伴明确“学习目标”、“当前进度”及“进步方向”。随着新型提示技术与LLM功能的快速发展，我们为教育者提供了基于最佳教学实践的指导原则，助力其高效利用免费LLMs开展形成性评估。此外，本文还探讨了LLMs在反馈生成中的作用，揭示了现有评估指标的局限性，这些指标未能充分捕捉任务、过程及自我调节层面的反馈细微差别。最后，我们为教育者和研究者提供了实用指南，包括具体的课堂策略和未来方向，如开发 robust metrics 以评估LLM生成的反馈、利用LLMs克服形成性评估中的系统性和文化障碍以及设计促进可迁移技能的AI感知评估策略，同时减少对LLM生成响应的过度依赖。通过在 established formative assessment framework 内构建讨论，本综述为以教学为导向的方式将LLMs整合到形成性评估中提供了全面的基础。

> Formative assessment is a cornerstone of effective teaching and learning, providing students with feedback to guide their learning. While there has been an exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various aspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to intelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly addressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we critically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping students, teachers, and peers understand "where learners are going," "where learners currently are," and "how to move learners forward" in the learning process. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM capabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively leverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in pedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in generating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics that inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as distinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels. Finally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including concrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust metrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic and cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware assessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating overreliance on LLM-generated responses. By structuring the discussion within an established formative assessment framework, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for integrating LLMs into formative assessment in a pedagogically informed manner.
