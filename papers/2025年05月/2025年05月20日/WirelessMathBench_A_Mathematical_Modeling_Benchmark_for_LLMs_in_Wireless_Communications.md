> WirelessMathBench: A Mathematical Modeling Benchmark for LLMs in Wireless Communications

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各类任务中表现卓越，但其在复杂、特定领域数学推理，尤其是无线通信领域的潜力仍未充分挖掘。为此，我们推出了WirelessMathBench——首个专注于评估LLMs在无线通信工程数学建模能力的基准测试。该基准包含587个精选问题，涵盖从基础多选题到复杂方程补全的多样化任务，全部严格遵循物理和量纲约束。实验结果显示，尽管多数模型在基础任务中表现优异，但在处理部分或完全遮挡的方程时，性能大幅下降，凸显当前LLMs的局限性。即使最佳模型DeepSeek-R1的平均准确率也只有38.05%，完整方程补全成功率更是低至7.83%。我们希望通过公开WirelessMathBench及其评估工具，助力开发更强大、领域感知的LLMs，推动无线系统分析及更广泛工程应用的发展。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions, all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83% success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and broader engineering applications.
