> Twin-2K-500: A dataset for building digital twins of over 2,000 people based on their answers to over 500 questions

# 摘要

> 基于大型语言模型的数字孪生模拟在 AI、社会科学和数字实验领域展现出巨大潜力，但受限于大规模公开个体数据的缺乏，这一领域的发展受到阻碍。为填补这一空白，我们推出一个大规模公开数据集，旨在全面捕捉个体人类行为。我们对具有代表性的 $N = 2,058$ 名美国参与者进行了四波调查，每人平均参与 2.42 小时，涵盖 500 个问题，涉及人口统计、心理、经济、个性和认知等多维度测量，还包括行为经济学实验重复和定价调查。最后一波调查重复了之前任务，以建立测试-重新测试准确性基线。初步分析显示数据质量高，有望用于构建精准预测个体和群体行为的数字孪生。通过公开完整数据集，我们为基于 LLM 的人格模拟开发和基准测试提供宝贵研究平台。此外，该数据集还支持广泛的社会科学研究，如跨构念相关性和异质性处理效应研究。

> LLM-based digital twin simulation, where large language models are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in AI, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real, individual-level datasets that are both large and publicly available. This lack of high-quality ground truth limits both the development and validation of digital twin methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, public dataset designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of $N = 2,058$ participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the US across four waves with 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. By making the full dataset publicly available, we aim to establish a valuable testbed for the development and benchmarking of LLM-based persona simulations. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale the dataset also enables broad social science research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.
