> Retrieval Augmented Decision-Making: A Requirements-Driven, Multi-Criteria Framework for Structured Decision Support

# 摘要

> 各行各业产生了大量结构复杂、内容分散的文档，如工业计划、技术指南和法规。这对专家和决策者的检索与理解提出了严峻挑战。现有基于LLM的增强检索生成方法虽能提供相关建议，但缺乏定量加权和可追溯的推理路径，难以实现多层次的透明决策支持。为解决这一问题，本文提出 RAD 方法，将多准则决策与 LLM 的语义理解能力相结合。该方法能从行业文档中自动提取关键标准，构建加权分层决策模型，并在模型指导下生成结构化报告。RAD 框架通过引入明确的权重分配和推理链，确保决策生成的准确性、完整性和可追溯性。实验表明，在各类决策任务中，RAD 生成的报告在细节、合理性和结构上显著优于现有方法，充分展现了其在复杂决策支持场景中的应用价值和潜力。

> Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as industrial plans, technical guidelines, and regulations that are structurally complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method, which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex decision support scenarios.
