# 摘要

> 制造环境正变得日益复杂且难以预测，主要由于需求波动和产品生命周期缩短等因素。这种复杂性要求实时决策和对干扰的快速适应。传统控制方法在动态工业环境中表现出响应性不足的局限性，凸显了对能够应对不可预见挑战的先进控制策略的需求。

多智能体系统通过分散决策权来应对这些挑战，使系统能够动态响应运营变化。然而，现有的多智能体系统在实时适应性、情境感知决策以及动态资源能力探索方面仍面临挑战。大型语言模型通过其情境感知决策能力，为克服这些限制提供了可能性。

本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的多智能体制造系统控制架构，旨在实时应对干扰，动态探索资源能力。通过基于仿真的案例研究，验证了该架构能有效提升系统韧性与灵活性。研究结果表明，与现有方法相比，该架构在吞吐量和资源利用率方面均有显著提升。

> Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
