> Voice CMS: updating the knowledge base of a digital assistant through conversation

# 摘要

> 本研究提出了一种基于多智能体LLM架构和语音用户界面（VUI）的解决方案，旨在更新数字助理的知识库。我们将其与传统图形内容管理系统（CMS）进行了对比，重点关注用户偏好与信息复杂性之间的关系。研究发现，语音界面的总体可用性评分略低于图形界面，但在处理简单任务时更受用户欢迎。令人欣喜的是，语音界面在复杂任务中的内容质量与图形界面不相上下。研究还发现，结合语音与图形界面优势的混合界面有望解决实验中发现的关键问题，例如通过图形反馈减轻认知负担，同时保持语音交互的直观性。这项研究凸显了对话界面在特定商业场景下作为高效知识管理工具的潜力。

> In this study, we propose a solution based on a multi-agent LLM architecture and a voice user interface (VUI) designed to update the knowledge base of a digital assistant. Its usability is evaluated in comparison to a more traditional graphical content management system (CMS), with a focus on understanding the relationship between user preferences and the complexity of the information being provided. The findings demonstrate that, while the overall usability of the VUI is rated lower than the graphical interface, it is already preferred by users for less complex tasks. Furthermore, the quality of content entered through the VUI is comparable to that achieved with the graphical interface, even for highly complex tasks. Obtained qualitative results suggest that a hybrid interface combining the strengths of both approaches could address the key challenges identified during the experiment, such as reducing cognitive load through graphical feedback while maintaining the intuitive nature of voice-based interactions. This work highlights the potential of conversational interfaces as a viable and effective method for knowledge management in specific business contexts.
