> Vision Meets Language: A RAG-Augmented YOLOv8 Framework for Coffee Disease Diagnosis and Farmer Assistance

# 摘要

> 人类作为社会性存在，与环境密不可分。生活方式、健康、饮食等都深深植根于农业与环境之中。守护这片土地与农业发展是每个人的责任。然而，传统农业模式常导致资源浪费与环境问题。精准农业应运而生，它以先进技术为武器，为农业注入新的活力。本文提出了一种融合三大AI技术的创新方法：目标检测、大型语言模型（LLM）和检索增强生成（RAG）。在这个独特框架中，视觉与语言模型携手合作，为树叶健康保驾护航。本研究推出了一款基于AI的精准农业系统，它以检索增强生成（RAG）为智慧大脑，结合自然语言处理（NLP）与YOLOv8技术，化身作物病害的火眼金睛。该系统直击大型语言模型（LLMs）痛点，特别是幻觉问题，为农民提供实时诊断与个性化治疗方案。系统设计了简洁易用的交互界面，农民只需上传患病叶片图片，即可获得精准的诊断结果与科学的防治建议，帮助减少农药使用，守护农民生计，推动绿色农业发展。本项目以可扩展性、可靠性和用户体验为核心，致力于打造更智能、更高效的RAG集成目标检测系统，为未来农业的智能化转型铺平道路。

> As a social being, we have an intimate bond with the environment. A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.
