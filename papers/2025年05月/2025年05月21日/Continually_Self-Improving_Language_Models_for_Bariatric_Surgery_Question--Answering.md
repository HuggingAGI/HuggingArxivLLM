# 摘要

> 代谢手术（MBS）作为治疗严重和致死性肥胖的金标准，其疗效依赖于患者与多学科团队的全程协作，包括术前准备和长期术后管理。然而，物流和获取障碍等医疗差距常影响患者及时获得可靠信息。为此，我们推出了bRAGgen，一种新型自适应检索增强生成（RAG）模型，可在回答信心不足时自动整合实时医学证据，确保回答的准确性和时效性。同时，我们还发布了bRAGq，一个经过专家验证的1302个代谢手术相关问题的数据集，作为首个针对全面MBS护理的大规模领域特定基准。在两阶段评估中，bRAGgen不仅超越现有模型，还在准确性和相关性方面表现出色，成为生成高质量临床回答的理想选择。

> While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review. Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.
