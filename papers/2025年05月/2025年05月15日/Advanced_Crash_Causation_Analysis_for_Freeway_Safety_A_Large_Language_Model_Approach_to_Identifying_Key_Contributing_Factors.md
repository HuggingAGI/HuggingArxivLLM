> Advanced Crash Causation Analysis for Freeway Safety: A Large Language Model Approach to Identifying Key Contributing Factors

# 摘要

> 理解交通事故的成因并制定减轻其严重性的策略至关重要。传统方法往往难以捕捉事故的复杂性，而本研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析高速公路事故数据。通过整理226篇相关研究，创建了涵盖环境、驾驶员、交通和设计因素的数据集。使用QLoRA对Llama3 8B模型进行微调后，通过零样本分类识别事故原因，无需预标记数据，并提供全面解释。结果表明，LLMs能有效识别主要原因，如酒驾、超速、 aggressive driving 和分心驾驶等。结合道路维护等事件数据，可提供更深入见解。研究通过专家问卷调查（88.89%的高同意度）验证了模型的实际价值，展示了LLMs在全面分析事故原因方面的潜力，并为规划者和政策制定者提供了实用的对策建议，以提升交通安全实践。

> Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226 traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding, aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety, as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety practices.
