# 摘要

> 临床证据源于严谨的研究与数据分析，为医疗专业人士提供科学依据，助其做出明智决策。然而，将临床证据融入实时实践面临诸多挑战，包括繁重的工作量、复杂的行业流程以及时间限制。这凸显了开发自动化证据合成工具的必要性，以支持临床环境中更高效、准确的决策。本研究推出Quicker——一款基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的证据驱动型临床决策支持系统。它通过自动化证据合成，生成遵循标准临床指南开发流程的临床建议。Quicker构建了从问题提出到临床建议生成的全阶段自动化链路，并借助集成工具和交互式界面支持个性化决策。为评估Quicker的能力，我们基于三种不同疾病的临床指南开发记录，构建了Q2CRBench-3基准数据集。实验结果彰显了Quicker的卓越表现：其细粒度问题分解可根据用户偏好定制，检索灵敏度媲美人类专家，文献筛选性能接近全面纳入相关研究。此外，Quicker辅助的证据评估有效支持了人工审查，而其建议相较于临床医生更具全面性和逻辑连贯性。在系统级测试中，单个审查员与Quicker的协作将建议开发时间缩短至20-40分钟。总体而言，我们的研究证实了Quicker在帮助医生更快、更可靠地做出基于证据的临床决策方面的巨大潜力。

> Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.
