> From First Draft to Final Insight: A Multi-Agent Approach for Feedback Generation

# 摘要

> 教师在生成大量高质量且及时反馈时面临巨大挑战。自动化技术，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs），展现出了巨大潜力。然而，现有LLMs研究在反馈质量上仍有提升空间。本研究提出了一种多智能体方法，通过“生成、评估和再生”（G-E-RG）进一步提升反馈质量。第一阶段采用了六种方法，结合三种反馈理论框架和两种提示方法：零样本和基于检索增强生成的链式思维（RAG_CoT）。结果显示，G-E-RG在六种方法的大部分维度上显著提升了反馈质量。具体表现为：(1) 评估准确性提升了3.36%至12.98%（p<0.001）；(2) 包含四个有效成分的反馈比例从27.72%提升至98.49%，提供批评、强调优点、鼓励主动性和促进对话等子维度显著提升（p<0.001）；(3) 大部分特征值显著改善（p<0.001），尽管某些子维度仍需提升；(4) 三种方法的反馈简洁性显著增强（p<0.001）。

> Producing large volumes of high-quality, timely feedback poses significant challenges to instructors. To address this issue, automation technologies-particularly Large Language Models (LLMs)-show great potential. However, current LLM-based research still shows room for improvement in terms of feedback quality. Our study proposed a multi-agent approach performing "generation, evaluation, and regeneration" (G-E-RG) to further enhance feedback quality. In the first-generation phase, six methods were adopted, combining three feedback theoretical frameworks and two prompt methods: zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation with chain-of-thought (RAG_CoT). The results indicated that, compared to first-round feedback, G-E-RG significantly improved final feedback across six methods for most dimensions. Specifically:(1) Evaluation accuracy for six methods increased by 3.36% to 12.98% (p<0.001); (2) The proportion of feedback containing four effective components rose from an average of 27.72% to an average of 98.49% among six methods, sub-dimensions of providing critiques, highlighting strengths, encouraging agency, and cultivating dialogue also showed great enhancement (p<0.001); (3) There was a significant improvement in most of the feature values (p<0.001), although some sub-dimensions (e.g., strengthening the teacher-student relationship) still require further enhancement; (4) The simplicity of feedback was effectively enhanced (p<0.001) for three methods.
