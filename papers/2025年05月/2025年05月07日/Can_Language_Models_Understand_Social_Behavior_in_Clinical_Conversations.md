# 摘要

> 医患沟通对健康和护理结果至关重要。有效沟通不仅依赖于临床信息的交流，还涉及一系列人际行为，即社交信号，这些信号通常通过非语言暗示传递，影响医患关系的质量。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步，它们在分析文本时推理情感和社会行为的能力显著提升。在临床环境中，如医患对话转录的自动化日益普及，LLMs在分析社交行为方面展现出巨大潜力。为探索LLMs在临床对话中追踪社交信号的能力，我们设计了特定任务提示，并使用涵盖20种社交信号（如医生的主导性、患者的温暖等）的标注数据集，评估了多种模型架构和提示风格的性能。我们开发了首个能追踪所有20种社交信号的系统，并揭示了LLMs行为模式。进一步分析模型配置和临床背景，为提升LLMs在医疗环境中处理社交信号任务的性能提供了宝贵见解。

> Effective communication between providers and their patients influences health and care outcomes. The effectiveness of such conversations has been linked not only to the exchange of clinical information, but also to a range of interpersonal behaviors; commonly referred to as social signals, which are often conveyed through non-verbal cues and shape the quality of the patient-provider relationship. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an increasing ability to infer emotional and social behaviors even when analyzing only textual information. As automation increases also in clinical settings, such as for transcription of patient-provider conversations, there is growing potential for LLMs to automatically analyze and extract social behaviors from these interactions. To explore the foundational capabilities of LLMs in tracking social signals in clinical dialogue, we designed task-specific prompts and evaluated model performance across multiple architectures and prompting styles using a highly imbalanced, annotated dataset spanning 20 distinct social signals such as provider dominance, patient warmth, etc. We present the first system capable of tracking all these 20 coded signals, and uncover patterns in LLM behavior. Further analysis of model configurations and clinical context provides insights for enhancing LLM performance on social signal processing tasks in healthcare settings.
