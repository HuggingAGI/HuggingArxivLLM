# 摘要

> 反馈在支持学生学习中扮演着重要角色。尽管自动化反馈系统已实现反馈的可扩展性，但现有解决方案多局限于文本反馈。根据多媒体学习原则，多模态学习有助于利用独立渠道、降低认知负荷并促进学习。因此，探索AI在多模态反馈生成中的潜力至关重要。本研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本反馈，并结合相关幻灯片（从幻灯片中心检索）进行补充。通过一项在线众包研究（N=91），本研究采用2x2实验设计（人工反馈与AI反馈、有无相关幻灯片），评估AI辅助多模态反馈的清晰度、吸引力、感知有效性和可靠性。研究发现所有条件下均存在显著学习增益，但不同条件下的增益差异不显著。后续调查显示，学生认为幻灯片反馈在学习中有帮助，尽管理解起来有困难。关于AI生成的开放性反馈，学生认为其个性化且与回答相关，但对AI反馈的信任度低于人工反馈。

> Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study (N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a 2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it. Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.
