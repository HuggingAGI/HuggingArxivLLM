> PACT: A Contract-Theoretic Framework for Pricing Agentic AI Services Powered by Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的智能体AI正迅速崛起，为各领域的自主推理、决策和任务执行提供了强大支持。尽管智能体AI展现出巨大潜力，但将其作为服务部署时，定价问题却面临多重挑战：高昂的基础设施与计算成本、多维且任务相关的服务质量（QoS），以及高风险应用中的法律责任风险。针对这些问题，我们提出了PACT——一个基于合同理论的云原生智能体AI服务定价框架。PACT从目标维度（如响应时间）和主观维度（如用户满意度）全面建模服务质量。该框架不仅综合考虑了服务提供者的计算、基础设施和潜在法律责任成本，还确保了在信息不对称环境下用户的激励兼容性和个体理性。通过基于合同的选择机制，用户能够获得量身定制的服务方案。数值评估表明，PACT显著提升了用户与服务提供者之间的服务质量一致性，并为未来智能体AI服务的定价提供了一种可扩展且负责任的解决方案。

> Agentic AI, often powered by large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly popular and adopted to support autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and task execution across various domains. While agentic AI holds great promise, its deployment as services for easy access raises critical challenges in pricing, due to high infrastructure and computation costs, multi-dimensional and task-dependent Quality of Service (QoS), and growing concerns around liability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose PACT, a Pricing framework for cloud-based Agentic AI services through a Contract-Theoretic approach, which models QoS along both objective (e.g., response time) and subjective (e.g., user satisfaction) dimensions. PACT accounts for computational, infrastructure, and potential liability costs for the service provider, while ensuring incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the user under information asymmetry. Through contract-based selection, users receive tailored service offerings aligned with their needs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that PACT improves QoS alignment between users and providers and offers a scalable, liable approach to pricing agentic AI services in the future.
