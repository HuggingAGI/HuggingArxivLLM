`LLM理论` `自动化规划`

> Make Planning Research Rigorous Again!

# 摘要

> 自规划领域诞生以来的六十余年里，该领域在构建能够解决前所未见规划问题的规划软件的理论与实践中做出了重大贡献。这些贡献是通过严格设计和评估规划系统这一既定实践实现的。我们认为，这种严谨性应当被应用于当前基于大型语言模型的规划研究趋势中。实现这一目标的一种方法是将自动化规划社区的见解、工具和数据恰当地融入基于LLM的规划器的设计与评估中。规划社区的经验和专业知识不仅在历史上具有重要意义；从这些经验中汲取的教训可能对加速基于LLM的规划器的开发起到关键作用。这一观点在近期大量重复和传播规划社区曾经遇到并吸取教训的同一陷阱的研究背景下显得尤为重要。我们相信，避免这些已知的陷阱将极大地有助于构建基于LLM的规划器以及规划领域的整体进步。
    

> In over sixty years since its inception, the field of planning has made significant contributions to both the theory and practice of building planning software that can solve a never-before-seen planning problem. This was done through established practices of rigorous design and evaluation of planning systems. It is our position that this rigor should be applied to the current trend of work on planning with large language models. One way to do so is by correctly incorporating the insights, tools, and data from the automated planning community into the design and evaluation of LLM-based planners. The experience and expertise of the planning community are not just important from a historical perspective; the lessons learned could play a crucial role in accelerating the development of LLM-based planners. This position is particularly important in light of the abundance of recent works that replicate and propagate the same pitfalls that the planning community has encountered and learned from. We believe that avoiding such known pitfalls will contribute greatly to the progress in building LLM-based planners and to planning in general.
