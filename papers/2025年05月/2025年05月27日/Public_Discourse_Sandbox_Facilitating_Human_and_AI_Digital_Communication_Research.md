> Public Discourse Sandbox: Facilitating Human and AI Digital Communication Research

# 摘要

> 社交媒体不仅是全球重大事件和娱乐的主要沟通平台，也是特定主题或利基社区讨论的聚集地。这对研究人员来说是一笔宝贵的资源，但数据获取却面临诸多挑战：机器人、虚假账户和操纵内容的干扰，往往导致数据获取困难、昂贵且不可靠。此外，若研究人员未明确告知社交媒体用户其意图便开展在线实验，还可能引发伦理争议。为解决这些问题，我们推出Public Discourse Sandbox（PDS），这是一个专注于人与AI、AI与AI话语研究的数字实验平台，旨在为无法在公开社交平台进行的研究提供安全可靠的环境。通过提示工程、检索增强生成（RAG）和微调等技术，PDS致力于帮助研究者深入理解AI行为及其定制化参与者的影响。我们不仅提供实时在线版本供研究人员使用，还开源了GitHub代码，邀请全球社区共同参与开发与贡献。

> Social media serves as a primary communication and information dissemination platform for major global events, entertainment, and niche or topically focused community discussions. Therefore, it represents a valuable resource for researchers who aim to understand numerous questions. However, obtaining data can be difficult, expensive, and often unreliable due to the presence of bots, fake accounts, and manipulated content. Additionally, there are ethical concerns if researchers decide to conduct an online experiment without explicitly notifying social media users about their intent. There is a need for more controlled and scalable mechanisms to evaluate the impacts of digital discussion interventions on audiences. We introduce the Public Discourse Sandbox (PDS), which serves as a digital discourse research platform for human-AI as well as AI-AI discourse research, testing, and training. PDS provides a safe and secure space for research experiments that are not viable on public, commercial social media platforms. Its main purpose is to enable the understanding of AI behaviors and the impacts of customized AI participants via techniques such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We provide a hosted live version of the sandbox to support researchers as well as the open-sourced code on GitHub for community collaboration and contribution.
