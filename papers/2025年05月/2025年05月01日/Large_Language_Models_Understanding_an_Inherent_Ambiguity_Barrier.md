> Large Language Models Understanding: an Inherent Ambiguity Barrier

# 摘要

> 围绕大型语言模型（LLMs）理解世界和捕捉对话意义的能力，一场热烈的讨论正在持续。基于思想实验、人与LLMs的对话实例、统计语言分析、哲学思考等，人们提出了各种论点和反论点。本文通过思想实验和半形式化分析，提出一种反论点，揭示了LLMs存在一种固有的模糊性障碍，这使得它们无法真正理解其流畅对话背后的含义。

> A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the world and capture the meaning of the dialogues in which they are involved. Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.
