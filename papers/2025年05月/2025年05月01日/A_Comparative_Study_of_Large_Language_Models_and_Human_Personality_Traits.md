# 摘要

> 大型语言模型展现类人特质，本研究深入探索其人格特性。研究采用行为观察法，通过三项实证研究发现：LLMs的人格特质具有高度流动性和外部依赖性，缺乏稳定性。我们提出的“分布式人格框架”揭示了LLM特质的动态本质。这些发现为人机交互和AI伦理发展提供了重要参考，标志着人格心理学在智能系统时代的全新突破。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality, focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1 examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid, externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.
