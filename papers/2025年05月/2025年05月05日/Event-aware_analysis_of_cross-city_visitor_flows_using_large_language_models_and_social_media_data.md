公共事件（如音乐会和烟花表演）可能导致跨城旅行需求激增，引发拥挤、延误和安全问题。为了更好地应对这种需求变化，估算跨城游客流时需考虑公共事件的影响。以往研究多聚焦于单一事件或场地，而本研究提出了一种通用框架，用于分析多种并发事件下的游客流动。我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从多源在线信息和社交媒体中提取事件特征，并设计了社交媒体流行度指标，捕捉在线推广和口碑对游客吸引力的影响。采用事件感知的机器学习模型，揭示不同事件特征的具体影响，并预测即将举行的活动的游客流动。以香港为例，框架成功预测了每天从内地抵达的游客流量，测试R平方值达85%以上。研究发现，推广和口碑对游客流量有显著影响，但具体效果因事件类型而异。这种关联在乘坐地铁和高铁的游客中更为明显，而对航空旅客影响较小。这些发现有助于政府协调措施，并为制定专项交通政策提供依据，如开通直达活动场地的接驳服务和实施全面的现场交通管理策略。

> Public events, such as music concerts and fireworks displays, can cause irregular surges in cross-city travel demand, leading to potential overcrowding, travel delays, and public safety concerns. To better anticipate and accommodate such demand surges, it is essential to estimate cross-city visitor flows with awareness of public events. Although prior studies typically focused on the effects of a single mega event or disruptions around a single venue, this study introduces a generalizable framework to analyze visitor flows under diverse and concurrent events. We propose to leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract event features from multi-source online information and massive user-generated content on social media platforms. Specifically, social media popularity metrics are designed to capture the effects of online promotion and word-of-mouth in attracting visitors. An event-aware machine learning model is then adopted to uncover the specific impacts of different event features and ultimately predict visitor flows for upcoming events. Using Hong Kong as a case study, the framework is applied to predict daily flows of mainland Chinese visitors arriving at the city, achieving a testing R-squared of over 85%. We further investigate the heterogeneous event impacts on visitor numbers across different event types and major travel modes. Both promotional popularity and word-of-mouth popularity are found to be associated with increased visitor flows, but the specific effects vary by the event type. This association is more pronounced among visitors arriving by metro and high-speed rail, while it has less effect on air travelers. The findings can facilitate coordinated measures across government agencies and guide specialized transport policies, such as shuttle transit services to event venues, and comprehensive on-site traffic management strategies.
