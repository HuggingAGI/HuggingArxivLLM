> Modeling the Impact of Group Interactions on Climate-related Opinion Change in Reddit

# 摘要

> 意见动力学模型描述了社会网络中行为变化的演变过程，对制定促进积极集体变革（如气候行动倡议）的战略至关重要。在社交媒体互动中，这些模型通常以配对形式表示社交交流，将互动编码为图结构，边表示信息从一个个体传递到另一个个体。然而，这种假设未能充分反映社交媒体中群体讨论的性质。为此，我们提出了一种时间超图模型，能够有效捕捉对话中的群体动态，并将其应用于 Reddit 上的气候变化讨论。该模型可预测个体用户层面对气候问题立场的时间变化。与传统依赖模拟或有限验证的研究不同，我们的方法通过基于大型语言模型对个体用户评论的全面基准测试进行了验证。研究发现，与基于配对交互的最先进模型相比，超图建模群体交互在预测意见形成的微观动力学方面更具优势。尽管如此，我们对在线空间中意见形成和演变的细微差别仍需进一步研究。

> Opinion dynamics models describe the evolution of behavioral changes within social networks and are essential for informing strategies aimed at fostering positive collective changes, such as climate action initiatives. When applied to social media interactions, these models typically represent social exchanges in a dyadic format to allow for a convenient encoding of interactions into a graph where edges represent the flow of information from one individual to another. However, this structural assumption fails to adequately reflect the nature of group discussions prevalent on many social media platforms. To address this limitation, we present a temporal hypergraph model that effectively captures the group dynamics inherent in conversational threads, and we apply it to discussions about climate change on Reddit. This model predicts temporal shifts in stance towards climate issues at the level of individual users. In contrast to traditional studies in opinion dynamics that typically rely on simulations or limited empirical validation, our approach is tested against a comprehensive ground truth estimated by a large language model at the level of individual user comments. Our findings demonstrate that using hypergraphs to model group interactions yields superior predictions of the microscopic dynamics of opinion formation, compared to state-of-the-art models based on dyadic interactions. Although our research contributes to the understanding of these complex social systems, significant challenges remain in capturing the nuances of how opinions are formed and evolve within online spaces.
