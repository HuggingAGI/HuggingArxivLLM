> WikiTermBase: An AI-Augmented Term Base to Standardize Arabic Translation on Wikipedia

# 摘要

> 术语库是翻译软件中公认的节省时间和保持一致性的最有效组件。尽管自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了诸多进展，但主要翻译平台尚未充分利用这些工具来优化其术语库，尤其是为那些在技术术语本地化方面面临挑战的非主流语言提供支持。例如，阿拉伯世界的语言学院自上世纪40年代起就致力于统一新科学术语进入阿拉伯语的规模化方式。本文介绍了一个开源工具——WikiTermBase（维基术语库），它采用系统化方法构建了一个包含90余万术语的词汇数据库，这些术语基于语义和形态学原则从多种来源收集并映射而成。该工具已成功应用于阿拉伯语维基百科，实现了英法语翻译术语的标准化。


> Term bases are recognized as one of the most effective components of translation software in time saving and consistency. In spite of the many recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), major translation platforms have yet to take advantage of these tools to improve their term bases and support scalable content for underrepresented languages, which often struggle with localizing technical terminology. Language academies in the Arab World, for example, have struggled since the 1940s to unify the way new scientific terms enter the Arabic language at scale. This abstract introduces an open source tool, WikiTermBase, with a systematic approach for building a lexicographical database with over 900K terms, which were collected and mapped from a multitude of sources on a semantic and morphological basis. The tool was successfully implemented on Arabic Wikipedia to standardize translated English and French terms.
