> CoderAgent: Simulating Student Behavior for Personalized Programming Learning with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 个性化编程辅导（如练习推荐）能够显著提升学习者的效率、动力及学习成果，在现代数字化教育中日益重要。然而，充足且高质量编程数据的缺乏，以及线下评估与实际学习环境的不匹配，阻碍了此类系统的实际应用。为解决这一难题，尽管许多方法尝试模拟学习者练习数据，但往往忽视了编程学习的细粒度、迭代特性，导致可解释性和颗粒度不足。为此，我们提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能体CoderAgent，无需真实数据即可细粒度模拟学生编程过程。具体而言，我们为每位学习者配备了一个智能体，其核心在于捕捉人类编程实践中的认知状态。受认知架构框架ACT-R启发，我们设计了CoderAgent的结构，通过聚焦编程知识掌握与编码能力应用，使其与人类认知架构相契合。基于对多层次认知推理模式的洞察，我们提出了编程思维树（PTOT），将其分解为“为什么、如何、哪里、什么”四个步骤，从而实现对迭代问题解决策略的详细分析。最终，基于真实数据集的实验验证表明，CoderAgent不仅能够提供学习轨迹的可解释性见解，还能实现精准模拟，为个性化编程教育的发展奠定了基础。

> Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity. To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent, the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought (PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized programming education.
