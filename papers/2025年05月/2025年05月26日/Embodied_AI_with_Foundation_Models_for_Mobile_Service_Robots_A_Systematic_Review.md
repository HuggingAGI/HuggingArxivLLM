# 摘要

> 大语言模型、视觉语言模型、多模态大语言模型以及视觉-语言-动作模型的快速发展为移动服务机器人中的具身AI带来了新的机遇。通过结合基础模型与具身AI理念，机器人能够通过物理交互进行感知、推理和行动，从而在动态真实环境中更好地理解、适应并执行复杂任务。然而，移动服务机器人中的具身AI仍面临多模态传感器融合、不确定性下的实时决策、任务泛化及人机交互等关键挑战。本文首次系统性地综述了基础模型在移动服务机器人中的融合应用，识别具身AI中的关键挑战，并探讨基础模型如何应对这些挑战。我们重点研究了这些模型在实时传感器融合、语言条件控制及自适应任务执行中的作用。此外，我们通过家庭辅助、医疗及服务自动化领域的实际应用，展示了基础模型对服务机器人行业的深远影响。最后，我们提出了未来研究方向，强调了预测扩展定律、自主长期适应及跨具身泛化的重要性，以实现基础模型在以人为中心的机器人系统中可扩展、高效且稳健的部署。

> Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.
