> BeliefNest: A Joint Action Simulator for Embodied Agents with Theory of Mind

# 摘要

> 本文推出开源模拟器BeliefNest，赋能具身智能体通过心智理论实现协作任务。该模拟器在Minecraft环境中动态构建分层模拟器，使智能体能够清晰表达自身与他人的嵌套信念状态。这为需要心智理论推理的开放任务提供了智能体控制能力。模拟器基于信念状态生成提示，助力设计和评估基于大型语言模型的智能体控制方法。实验结果表明，智能体在错误信念任务中能准确推断他人信念并预测其行为。

> This paper introduces an open-source simulator, BeliefNest, designed to enable embodied agents to perform collaborative tasks by leveraging Theory of Mind. BeliefNest dynamically and hierarchically constructs simulators within a Minecraft environment, allowing agents to explicitly represent nested belief states about themselves and others. This enables agent control in open-domain tasks that require Theory of Mind reasoning. The simulator provides a prompt generation mechanism based on each belief state, facilitating the design and evaluation of methods for agent control utilizing large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate through experiments that agents can infer others' beliefs and predict their belief-based actions in false-belief tasks.
