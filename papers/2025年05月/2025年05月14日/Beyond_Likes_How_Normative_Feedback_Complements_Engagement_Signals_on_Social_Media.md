> Beyond Likes: How Normative Feedback Complements Engagement Signals on Social Media

# 摘要

> # 摘要
许多在线平台将互动信号（如点赞和投票）融入内容排名和界面设计，旨在提升用户互动。然而，这些信号可能无意中放大了不够包容的内容，并可能不支持理想的行为模式。值得注意的是，毒性内容往往与点赞和投票等流行指标高度相关。本研究提出了一种基于规范标准的结构化亲社会反馈（prosocial feedback），作为对传统互动信号的补充。我们开发了一个由大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的机器学习反馈系统，该系统根据积极心理学原则（如个人幸福感、建设性社交媒体使用和性格优势）评估用户评论。通过预注册用户研究，我们发现：同伴反馈增加了对流行提示的遵从性，而专家反馈则引导用户更倾向于选择规范上更优质的内容。结合专家反馈与同伴评估，不仅提升了与专家评估的一致性，还显著改善了社区环境。这表明，基于心理学评分标准生成的专家评分等规范提示具有重要价值，将其纳入平台反馈系统有望促进更健康的在线环境。

> Many online platforms incorporate engagement signals--such as likes and upvotes--into their content ranking systems and interface design. These signals are designed to boost user engagement. However, they can unintentionally elevate content that is less inclusive and may not support normatively desirable behavior. This issue becomes especially concerning when toxic content correlates strongly with popularity indicators such as likes and upvotes. In this study, we propose structured prosocial feedback as a complementary signal to likes and upvotes--one that highlights content quality based on normative criteria to help address the limitations of conventional engagement signals. We begin by designing and implementing a machine learning feedback system powered by a large language model (LLM), which evaluates user comments based on principles of positive psychology, such as individual well-being, constructive social media use, and character strengths. We then conduct a pre-registered user study to examine how existing peer-based and the new expert-based feedback interact to shape users' selection of comments in a social media setting. Results show that peer feedback increases conformity to popularity cues, while expert feedback shifts preferences toward normatively higher-quality content. Moreover, incorporating expert feedback alongside peer evaluations improves alignment with expert assessments and contributes to a less toxic community environment. This illustrates the added value of normative cues--such as expert scores generated by LLMs using psychological rubrics--and underscores the potential benefits of incorporating such signals into platform feedback systems to foster healthier online environments.
