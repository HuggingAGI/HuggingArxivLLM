> KOKKAI DOC: An LLM-driven framework for scaling parliamentary representatives

# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的框架，用于准确衡量国会议员的政治立场。通过结合先进的自然语言处理技术与大型语言模型，本研究在前人方法基础上实现了三大突破：(1) 通过摘要技术对国会演讲进行去噪处理，生成更干净、一致的意见嵌入；(2) 自动提取立法者演讲中的政治争议轴；(3) 通过历时分析追踪党派立场的演变。我们通过定量和定性评估验证了本方法的有效性。定量结果显示，该方法在各类政治议题上的预测结果与专家预测高度相关；定性分析则揭示了语言模式与政治意识形态之间的深层关联。我们希望这项研究不仅停留在学术层面，更希望通过 Kokkaidoc.com 网站向公众开放研究成果，帮助日本选民基于数据洞察做出更明智的投票决策。这项研究为将大型语言模型应用于政治科学领域提供了灵活可靠的框架，同时也探索了其在现实世界中的实际应用价值。

> This paper introduces an LLM-driven framework designed to accurately scale the political issue stances of parliamentary representatives. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and large language models, the proposed methodology refines and enhances previous approaches by addressing key challenges such as noisy speech data, manual bias in selecting political axes, and the lack of dynamic, diachronic analysis. The framework incorporates three major innovations: (1) de-noising parliamentary speeches via summarization to produce cleaner, more consistent opinion embeddings; (2) automatic extraction of axes of political controversy from legislators' speech summaries; and (3) a diachronic analysis that tracks the evolution of party positions over time.
  We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to verify our methodology. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate high correlation with expert predictions across various political topics, while qualitative analyses reveal meaningful associations between language patterns and political ideologies. This research aims to have an impact beyond the field of academia by making the results accessible by the public on teh web application: kokkaidoc.com. We are hoping that through our application, Japanese voters can gain a data-driven insight into the political landscape which aids them to make more nuanced voting decisions.
  Overall, this work contributes to the growing body of research that applies LLMs in political science, offering a flexible and reliable framework for scaling political positions from parliamentary speeches. But also explores the practical applications of the research in the real world to have real world impact.
