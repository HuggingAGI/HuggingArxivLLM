> 理解与预测人类行为已成为自动驾驶、智能医疗、监控系统和社会机器人学等AI应用领域中的核心能力。本文定义了行为智能（ABI）的技术框架，该框架能够全面解析和解读人类的姿态、面部表情、情绪、行为序列和环境线索。文中详细阐述了ABI的关键组成部分，包括姿态估计、面部与情绪识别、行为序列分析以及环境感知建模。此外，我们还探讨了大规模预训练模型（如大型语言模型（LLMs）、视觉基础模型和多模态融合模型）的突破性进展，这些进展在显著提升行为识别的准确性和可解释性方面具有巨大潜力。我们的研究团队对ABI领域充满热情，正在积极开展相关研究，尤其专注于开发能够高效推断复杂人类行为的智能轻量化模型。本文还指出了在实际应用中部署ABI技术所必须解决的技术挑战，包括从有限数据中学习行为智能、量化复杂行为预测中的不确定性以及优化模型结构以实现低功耗实时推断。为应对这些挑战，我们的团队正在探索多种优化策略，包括轻量化Transformer、基于图的识别架构、能耗感知损失函数和多模态知识蒸馏，同时在实时环境中验证这些策略的有效性。

> Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.
