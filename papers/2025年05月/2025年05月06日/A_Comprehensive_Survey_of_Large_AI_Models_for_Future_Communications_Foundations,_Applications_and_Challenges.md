# 摘要

> 6G无线通信致力于构建一个无处不在的智能互联世界，带来前所未有的通信体验。大型人工智能模型（LAMs）相较于传统AI模型，具有显著更大的规模（如数十亿或数万亿参数），展现出卓越的认知能力，包括强大的泛化能力和处理新任务的涌现能力。因此，LAMs成为解决未来无线通信复杂挑战的关键工具，为多样化通信应用提供高效AI服务。本研究全面回顾了LAMs在通信领域的基础、应用及挑战。首先，我们介绍了基于AI的通信系统现状，强调了LAMs在通信中的整合动机，并总结了主要贡献。接着，我们概述了LAMs在通信中的核心概念，包括Transformer、扩散模型和Mamba等主要架构的介绍。我们还探讨了LAMs的分类（如大型语言模型LLMs、大型视觉模型LVMs、大型多模态模型LMMs和世界模型），并考察了它们在通信中的潜在应用。此外，我们涵盖了通信系统中LAMs的训练方法和评估技术。最后，我们介绍了优化策略，如思维链（CoT）、检索增强生成（RAG）和智能体系统。随后，我们讨论了LAMs在各种通信场景下的研究进展。最后，我们分析了当前研究中的挑战，并提供了对未来潜在研究方向的见解。

> The 6G wireless communications aim to establish an intelligent world of ubiquitous connectivity, providing an unprecedented communication experience. Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are characterized by significantly larger scales (e.g., billions or trillions of parameters) compared to typical artificial intelligence (AI) models. LAMs exhibit outstanding cognitive abilities, including strong generalization capabilities for fine-tuning to downstream tasks, and emergent capabilities to handle tasks unseen during training. Therefore, LAMs efficiently provide AI services for diverse communication applications, making them crucial tools for addressing complex challenges in future wireless communication systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of the foundations, applications, and challenges of LAMs in communication. First, we introduce the current state of AI-based communication systems, emphasizing the motivation behind integrating LAMs into communications and summarizing the key contributions. We then present an overview of the essential concepts of LAMs in communication. This includes an introduction to the main architectures of LAMs, such as transformer, diffusion models, and mamba. We also explore the classification of LAMs, including large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and world models, and examine their potential applications in communication. Additionally, we cover the training methods and evaluation techniques for LAMs in communication systems. Lastly, we introduce optimization strategies such as chain of thought (CoT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. Following this, we discuss the research advancements of LAMs across various communication scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges in the current research and provide insights into potential future research directions.
