> MVHumanNet++: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Daily Dressing Human Captures with Richer Annotations for 3D Human Digitization

# 摘要

> 在当今时代，大型语言模型和文本到图像模型的成功主要得益于大规模数据集的推动。然而，在3D视觉领域，尽管基于对象的任务通过Objaverse和MVImgNet等大规模数据集取得了显著进展，但以人为中心的任务却因缺乏相应的大规模人体数据集而进展有限。为此，我们推出了MVHumanNet++，一个包含4500个人体身份多视角动作序列的数据集。我们的工作重点在于通过多视角人体捕捉系统，采集大量多样化身份和日常服装的人体数据，从而实现易于扩展的数据采集。我们的数据集包含9000套日常服装、60000个动作序列和64.5亿帧，带有丰富的标注信息，包括人体遮罩、相机参数、2D和3D关键点、SMPL/SMPLX参数以及相应的文本描述。此外，我们提出的MVHumanNet++数据集还增强了新处理的法线贴图和深度贴图，极大地扩展了其在以人为中心的高级研究中的适用性和实用性。为了探索MVHumanNet++数据集在各种2D和3D视觉任务中的潜力，我们进行了多项试点研究，展示了其规模带来的性能提升和有效应用。作为当前规模最大的3D人体数据集，我们希望MVHumanNet++数据集的发布能够推动大规模3D人体相关任务的进一步创新。MVHumanNet++可在https://kevinlee09.github.io/research/MVHumanNet++/公开获取。

> In this era, the success of large language models and text-to-image models can be attributed to the driving force of large-scale datasets. However, in the realm of 3D vision, while significant progress has been achieved in object-centric tasks through large-scale datasets like Objaverse and MVImgNet, human-centric tasks have seen limited advancement, largely due to the absence of a comparable large-scale human dataset. To bridge this gap, we present MVHumanNet++, a dataset that comprises multi-view human action sequences of 4,500 human identities. The primary focus of our work is on collecting human data that features a large number of diverse identities and everyday clothing using multi-view human capture systems, which facilitates easily scalable data collection. Our dataset contains 9,000 daily outfits, 60,000 motion sequences and 645 million frames with extensive annotations, including human masks, camera parameters, 2D and 3D keypoints, SMPL/SMPLX parameters, and corresponding textual descriptions. Additionally, the proposed MVHumanNet++ dataset is enhanced with newly processed normal maps and depth maps, significantly expanding its applicability and utility for advanced human-centric research. To explore the potential of our proposed MVHumanNet++ dataset in various 2D and 3D visual tasks, we conducted several pilot studies to demonstrate the performance improvements and effective applications enabled by the scale provided by MVHumanNet++. As the current largest-scale 3D human dataset, we hope that the release of MVHumanNet++ dataset with annotations will foster further innovations in the domain of 3D human-centric tasks at scale. MVHumanNet++ is publicly available at https://kevinlee09.github.io/research/MVHumanNet++/.
