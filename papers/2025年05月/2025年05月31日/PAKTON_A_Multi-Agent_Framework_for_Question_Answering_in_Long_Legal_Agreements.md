> PAKTON: A Multi-Agent Framework for Question Answering in Long Legal Agreements

# 摘要

> 合同审查是一项复杂且耗时的任务，通常需要专业的法律知识，这让非专业人士难以参与其中。法律解释往往充满模糊性，判断结果常常依赖主观评估。此外，合同的保密性限制了专有模型的使用，推动了对开源工具的需求。为了解决这些挑战，我们推出了PAKTON：一个完全开源、端到端、多智能体框架，支持即插即用功能。通过协作智能体工作流程和一种创新的检索增强生成（RAG）组件，PAKTON能够有效应对合同分析的复杂性，实现更易于访问、适应性强且保护隐私的自动化法律文档审查。实验结果表明，PAKTON在预测准确性、检索性能、可解释性、完整性和有根据的解释方面均优于通用和预训练模型，这些结论通过人类研究评估并用自动化指标验证。

> Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.
