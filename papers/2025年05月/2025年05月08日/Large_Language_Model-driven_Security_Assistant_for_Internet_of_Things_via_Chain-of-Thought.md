# 摘要

> 物联网技术的飞速发展不仅改变了人们的生活方式，更深刻影响了生产和日常生活。然而，物联网技术的快速发展也带来了设备安全问题，这在研究和应用中日益凸显。尽管已有一些方法用于检测或缓解物联网安全漏洞，但它们往往难以应对物联网环境的复杂性，尤其在处理动态安全场景时显得力不从心。如何自动、高效且精准地识别这些漏洞仍是当前的一大挑战。

针对这一问题，我们提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的物联网安全助手，旨在提升LLM对物联网安全漏洞及其相关威胁的理解能力。我们提出的ICoT方法通过分解安全漏洞的各个维度，使LLM能够更深入地理解安全问题，并生成符合用户特定需求和专业知识水平的解决方案。借助ICoT，LLM可以逐步分析和推理复杂的安全场景，从而提供更准确、深入且个性化的安全建议和解决方案。

实验结果表明，与仅依赖LLM的传统方法相比，我们提出的基于LLM的物联网安全助手通过ICoT方法显著提升了对物联网安全问题的理解能力，并能根据用户的实际身份提供个性化的解决方案，展现出更高的准确性和可靠性。

> The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios, resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating higher accuracy and reliability.
