> Position: Epistemic Artificial Intelligence is Essential for Machine Learning Models to Know When They Do Not Know

# 摘要

> 尽管AI在生成模型和大型语言模型方面取得了显著进展，但其在处理不确定性和泛化能力上仍存在重大缺口。尤其在自主系统中，AI模型面对陌生或对抗性数据时往往表现不佳，这一点在自动驾驶事故中可见一斑。传统机器学习方法因过度关注数据拟合和领域适应，难以解决这一问题。本文提出向知识论人工智能转变的主张，强调模型不仅要从已知中学习，更要从其无知中汲取经验。通过专注于识别和管理不确定性，这一方法有望提升AI系统的韧性和稳健性，使其更好地应对不可预测的现实环境。

> Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can better handle unpredictable real-world environments.
