> Software Development Life Cycle Perspective: A Survey of Benchmarks for CodeLLMs and Agents

# 摘要

> 代码大型语言模型（CodeLLMs）和智能体在处理复杂软件工程任务方面展现出巨大潜力。相比传统方法，它们不仅能力更强，还能灵活处理自然语言和代码形式的输入输出。基准测试在评估CodeLLMs和智能体能力、指导其发展和应用中发挥关键作用。然而，尽管其重要性日益凸显，现有研究仍缺乏对CodeLLMs和智能体基准的全面综述。为填补这一空白，本文对现有181个基准进行了全面分析，覆盖了来自461篇相关论文，并贯穿软件开发生命周期（SDLC）的各个阶段。研究发现，当前基准的覆盖范围严重失衡，约60%的基准集中在软件开发阶段，而需求工程和软件设计阶段仅分别占5%和3%。此外，Python在所有综述基准中占据主导地位。最后，本文总结了当前研究的挑战，并提出了未来方向，旨在缩小CodeLLMs和智能体理论能力与实际应用场景之间的差距。

> Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.
