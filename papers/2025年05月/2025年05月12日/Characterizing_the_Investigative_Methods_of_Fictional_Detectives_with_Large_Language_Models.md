> 侦探小说以复杂叙事结构和人物驱动叙事为特点，为计算叙事学带来了独特挑战。计算叙事学致力于将文学理论融入自动叙事生成。传统文学研究为虚构侦探的方法和原型提供了深刻见解，但分析范围有限，缺乏可扩展性。本文提出了一种基于AI的方法，系统刻画虚构侦探的调查方法。我们的多阶段工作流程探讨了15个大型语言模型（LLMs）在提取、综合和验证虚构侦探独特调查特征方面的功能。该方法在七位标志性侦探——赫尔克里·波洛、夏洛克·福尔摩斯、威廉·默多克、科伦坡、布朗神父、马普尔小姐和奥古斯特·杜宾——的多样化案例上进行了测试，捕捉到定义每个角色的独特调查风格。通过与现有文学分析的对比验证以及反向识别阶段的进一步测试，整体准确率达到91.43%，证明了该方法的有效性。这项研究通过提供一个可扩展的框架来分析角色，为计算叙事学做出了贡献，其潜在应用包括基于AI的互动叙事和自动叙事生成。

> Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin - capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive storytelling and automated narrative generation.
