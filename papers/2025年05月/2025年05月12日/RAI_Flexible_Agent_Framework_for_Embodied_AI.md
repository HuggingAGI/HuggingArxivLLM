> RAI: Flexible Agent Framework for Embodied AI

# 摘要

> 随着生成式语言模型能力的提升，人们对具身AI的兴趣也日益增长。本文介绍的RAI框架，旨在创建机器人领域的具身多智能体系统。该框架整合了机器人堆栈、大型语言模型以及仿真工具，为具身多智能体系统提供了强有力的支持。它还与ROS 2等先进系统无缝对接，方便用户快速上手。此外，该框架还为智能体的具身化提供了专门的机制。这些机制已在Husarion ROSBot XL物理机器人及其数字孪生体上进行了测试，为快速原型设计提供了支持。此外，这些机制还被部署在两种仿真场景中：(1) 机械臂操作和(2)拖拉机控制器。所有部署都从控制能力、具身化效果和感知能力三个方面进行了评估。该框架已成功用于构建多智能体系统，并在所有上述任务中表现出色。它还帮助识别并解决了用于具身AI的生成模型的不足之处。

> With an increase in the capabilities of generative language models, a growing interest in embodied AI has followed. This contribution introduces RAI - a framework for creating embodied Multi Agent Systems for robotics. The proposed framework implements tools for Agents' integration with robotic stacks, Large Language Models, and simulations. It provides out-of-the-box integration with state-of-the-art systems like ROS 2. It also comes with dedicated mechanisms for the embodiment of Agents. These mechanisms have been tested on a physical robot, Husarion ROSBot XL, which was coupled with its digital twin, for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, these mechanisms have been deployed in two simulations: (1) robot arm manipulator and (2) tractor controller. All of these deployments have been evaluated in terms of their control capabilities, effectiveness of embodiment, and perception ability. The proposed framework has been used successfully to build systems with multiple agents. It has demonstrated effectiveness in all the aforementioned tasks. It also enabled identifying and addressing the shortcomings of the generative models used for embodied AI.
