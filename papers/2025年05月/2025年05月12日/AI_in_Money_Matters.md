> 2022年11月，ChatGPT的横空出世令欧洲乃至全球为之震撼。自此，关于这一工具及其社会价值的学术讨论和公众热议在LinkedIn和X（原名Twitter）等平台上此起彼伏。然而，专业领域尤其是金融和法律等受监管行业从业者的真实看法却少有人问津。我们希望通过一项针对金融科技行业从业者的实证调查，开始填补这一空白。本文探讨：大型语言模型（尤其是ChatGPT）在金融科技行业中是如何被采用和使用的？研究发现，尽管受访的金融科技专家看好大型语言模型的未来潜力，但如何监管以及因此可能在受监管行业如金融科技中被采用的问题仍存诸多疑问。本文旨在为大型语言模型的学术讨论添砖加瓦，增进我们对专业观点的理解。

> In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models, with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints.
