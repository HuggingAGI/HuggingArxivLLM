澳大利亚和英国在电子烟监管方面采取了截然不同的策略，澳大利亚以严格著称，英国则相对宽容。尽管两国政策基于相同的证据基础，却走向了不同的监管道路。本文通过开发并评估一种基于大型语言模型的句子分类器，对来自澳大利亚和英国的109份官方电子烟政策文件进行了自动化分析。我们借助GPT-4自动识别文件中关于电子烟对公共健康有益或有害的声明。结果显示，我们的分类器达到了0.9的F分数。进一步分析发现，澳大利亚文件中强调电子烟危害的比例远高于预期，而英国文件则更多突出其益处。这表明，尽管基于相同证据，两国政策文件对电子烟的态度截然不同。我们的研究不仅为理解证据与卫生政策制定之间的复杂关系提供了新视角，也为未来基于LLM的研究方法奠定了基础。

> Australia and the UK have developed contrasting approaches to the regulation of electronic cigarettes, with - broadly speaking - Australia adopting a relatively restrictive approach and the UK adopting a more permissive approach. Notably, these divergent policies were developed from the same broad evidence base. In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4 to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the benefits. Further, our approach provides a starting point for using LLM-based methods to investigate the complex relationship between evidence and health policy formation.
