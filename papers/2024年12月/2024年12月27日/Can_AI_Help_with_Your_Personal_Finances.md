> 近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在人工智能（AI）领域异军突起，成为一项变革性的发展成果，吸引了工业界和学术界的高度关注。这些复杂的AI系统通过在海量数据集上训练，展现出了出色的自然语言处理和内容生成能力。本文聚焦于美国，探究了LLMs在解决个人金融关键挑战方面的潜力。我们对包括OpenAI的ChatGPT、谷歌的Gemini、Anthropic的Claude和Meta的Llama等几个领先的LLMs进行了评估，以衡量它们在提供诸如抵押贷款、税收、贷款和投资等主题的准确财务建议方面的成效。研究发现，虽然这些模型的平均准确率约为70%，但在某些方面仍存在明显的局限性。具体来说，LLMs在应对复杂的财务问题时难以给出准确回答，且在不同主题上的表现差异较大。尽管存在这些不足，但分析表明这些模型的新版本有显著改进，凸显了它们对于个人和财务顾问的实用性在不断增强。随着这些AI系统的持续演进，其在推动个人金融领域的AI驱动应用方面的潜力愈发可观。

> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.
