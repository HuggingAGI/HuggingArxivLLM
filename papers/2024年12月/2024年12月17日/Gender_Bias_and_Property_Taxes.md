> 性别偏见会扭曲女性和家庭的经济行为及结果。我们对财产税中的性别偏见展开了调查。我们分析了超 10 万次财产税上诉听证会的记录以及超 2.7 年的相关音频资料，研究小组成员和上诉人的性别与听证结果之间的关联。首先，我们发现女性上诉人在听证中的表现系统性地不如男性上诉人。其次，男性上诉人的听证结果不会因面对的小组成员性别构成不同而有显著变化，而女性上诉人则不然，面对女性（男性）小组成员时，女性上诉人房屋价值的减少（增加）幅度会系统性地更小（更大）。接着，我们运用多模态大型语言模型（M-LLM），依据听证音频记录构建参与者的行为和语气衡量标准。我们观察到男性和女性上诉人的行为有显著差异，对于男性上诉人，我们发现这些差异还取决于他们所面对的小组成员的性别（比如，男性上诉人似乎对女性小组成员表现得更具攻击性）。相比之下，女性上诉人的行为不论小组性别如何都相对稳定。最后，即便根据上诉人在听证中的行为和语气进行限定，女性上诉人在女性小组面前的情况依然更糟。所以，我们的结果与性别偏见至少部分由 ARB 小组成员未表达的信念和看法所驱动这一观点相符。我们的研究揭示了财产评估上诉听证中存在的性别偏见，并突显了生成式人工智能在分析大规模非结构化行政数据方面的潜在价值。

> Gender bias distorts the economic behavior and outcomes of women and households. We investigate gender biases in property taxes. We analyze records of more than 100,000 property tax appeal hearings and more than 2.7 years of associated audio recordings, considering how panelist and appellant genders associate with hearing outcomes. We first observe that female appellants fare systematically worse than male appellants in their hearings. Second, we show that, whereas male appellants' hearing outcomes do not vary meaningfully with the gender composition of the panel they face, those of female appellants' do, such that female appellants obtain systematically lesser (greater) reductions to their home values when facing female (male) panelists. Employing a multi-modal large language model (M-LLM), we next construct measures of participant behavior and tone from hearing audio recordings. We observe markedly different behaviors between male and female appellants and, in the case of male appellants, we find that these differences also depend on the gender of the panelists they face (e.g., male appellants appear to behave systematically more aggressively towards female panelists). In contrast, the behavior of female appellants remains relatively constant, regardless of their panel's gender. Finally, we show that female appellants continue to fare worse in front of female panels, even when we condition upon the appelant's in-hearing behavior and tone. Our results are thus consistent with the idea that gender biases are driven, at least in part, by unvoiced beliefs and perceptions on the part of ARB panelists. Our study documents the presence of gender biases in property appraisal appeal hearings and highlights the potential value of generative AI for analyzing large-scale, unstructured administrative data.
