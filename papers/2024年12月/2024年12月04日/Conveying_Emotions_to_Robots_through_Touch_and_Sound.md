> Conveying Emotions to Robots through Touch and Sound

# 摘要

> 人类的情感能够借由细微的触摸手势传递。然而，对于情感通过触摸向机器人传递的一致性，我们知之甚少。本研究通过融合触觉与听觉对情感触觉表达的感知解读，探究了面向机器人基于触摸的情感表达的一致性。我们研发了一种压阻式压力传感器，并运用麦克风分别模拟触摸和声音通道。在一项有 28 名参与者的研究里，每人都通过自发的触摸手势向机器人传达了 10 种情感。我们的发现表明，参与者之间在情感表达上存在统计学意义上显著的一致性。不过，有些情感的组内相关值较低。另外，某些具有相似唤醒程度或效价的情感在传递方式上未呈现显著差别。随后，我们构建了一个多模态整合触摸和音频特征来解码这 10 种情感。支持向量机（SVM）模型的准确性最高，对于 10 个类别达到 40%，其中“注意”是传递最准确的情感，平衡准确率为 87.65%。

> Human emotions can be conveyed through nuanced touch gestures. However, there is a lack of understanding of how consistently emotions can be conveyed to robots through touch. This study explores the consistency of touch-based emotional expression toward a robot by integrating tactile and auditory sensory reading of affective haptic expressions. We developed a piezoresistive pressure sensor and used a microphone to mimic touch and sound channels, respectively. In a study with 28 participants, each conveyed 10 emotions to a robot using spontaneous touch gestures. Our findings reveal a statistically significant consistency in emotion expression among participants. However, some emotions obtained low intraclass correlation values. Additionally, certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not exhibit significant differences in the way they were conveyed. We subsequently constructed a multi-modal integrating touch and audio features to decode the 10 emotions. A support vector machine (SVM) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving 40% for 10 classes, with "Attention" being the most accurately conveyed emotion at a balanced accuracy of 87.65%.
