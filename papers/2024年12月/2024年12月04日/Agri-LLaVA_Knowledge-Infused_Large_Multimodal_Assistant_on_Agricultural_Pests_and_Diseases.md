# 摘要

> 在一般领域，大型多模态模型（LMMs）已取得显著进展，然而在将其应用于特定领域，尤其是农业时，仍面临挑战。农业作为全球经济的支柱，面临诸多难题，其中病虫害因复杂、多变、传播迅速和抗性强等特性尤为令人担忧。本文聚焦这些问题。我们构建了农业领域首个多模态指令跟随数据集，涵盖超 221 种病虫害，约 40 万条数据。此数据集旨在探索并应对病虫害防控的独特挑战。基于该数据集，我们提出一种知识注入的训练方法，开发出农业多模态对话系统 Agri-LLaVA。为加速该领域发展并吸引更多研究者参与，我们为农业病虫害设计了多样化且具挑战性的评估基准。实验结果显示，Agri-LLaVA 在农业多模态对话和视觉理解方面表现卓越，为解决农业病虫害问题提供了新的思路和方法。通过将我们的数据集和模型开源，我们期望推动农业领域 LMMs 的研究与开发，为应对农业病虫害挑战作出重要贡献。所有资源均可在 https://github.com/Kki2Eve/Agri-LLaVA 找到。

> In the general domain, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements, yet challenges persist in applying them to specific fields, especially agriculture. As the backbone of the global economy, agriculture confronts numerous challenges, with pests and diseases being particularly concerning due to their complexity, variability, rapid spread, and high resistance. This paper specifically addresses these issues. We construct the first multimodal instruction-following dataset in the agricultural domain, covering over 221 types of pests and diseases with approximately 400,000 data entries. This dataset aims to explore and address the unique challenges in pest and disease control. Based on this dataset, we propose a knowledge-infused training method to develop Agri-LLaVA, an agricultural multimodal conversation system. To accelerate progress in this field and inspire more researchers to engage, we design a diverse and challenging evaluation benchmark for agricultural pests and diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that Agri-LLaVA excels in agricultural multimodal conversation and visual understanding, providing new insights and approaches to address agricultural pests and diseases. By open-sourcing our dataset and model, we aim to promote research and development in LMMs within the agricultural domain and make significant contributions to tackle the challenges of agricultural pests and diseases.
