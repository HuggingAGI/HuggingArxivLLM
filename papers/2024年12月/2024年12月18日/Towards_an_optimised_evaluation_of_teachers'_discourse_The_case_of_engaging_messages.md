# 摘要

> 评估教师的技能对于提升教育质量和学生成绩极为关键。教师话语对学生表现影响显著，是关键要素。然而，为这种话语编码颇为费力。本研究通过引入新方法来优化对教师话语的评估，从而解决了这一问题。该研究涵盖两项，均在中学教师使用的参与性信息框架内。第一项研究是在两个学年的音频录制课程的真实示例上训练两个大型语言模型，从课程转录本中识别并分类参与性信息。结果显示，识别和分类的灵敏度分别达 84.31%和 91.11%，特异性分别为 97.69%和 86.36%。第二项研究将这些模型应用于第三个学年音频录制课程的转录本，以查看按教育水平和学年时段划分的信息类型的频率与分布。结果表明，教师主要使用强调参与好处（与成绩提升相关）的信息，而三分之一强调了不参与的坏处（与焦虑增加有关）。参与性信息的使用在 12 年级和学年末期有所减少。这些发现提示了优化参与性信息使用的潜在干预措施，有助于提高教学质量和学生成绩。

> Evaluating teachers' skills is crucial for enhancing education quality and student outcomes. Teacher discourse, significantly influencing student performance, is a key component. However, coding this discourse can be laborious. This study addresses this issue by introducing a new methodology for optimising the assessment of teacher discourse. The research consisted of two studies, both within the framework of engaging messages used by secondary education teachers. The first study involved training two large language models on real-world examples from audio-recorded lessons over two academic years to identify and classify the engaging messages from the lessons' transcripts. This resulted in sensitivities of 84.31% and 91.11%, and specificities of 97.69% and 86.36% in identification and classification, respectively. The second study applied these models to transcripts of audio-recorded lessons from a third academic year to examine the frequency and distribution of message types by educational level and moment of the academic year. Results showed teachers predominantly use messages emphasising engagement benefits, linked to improved outcomes, while one-third highlighted non-engagement disadvantages, associated with increased anxiety. The use of engaging messages declined in Grade 12 and towards the academic year's end. These findings suggest potential interventions to optimise engaging message use, enhancing teaching quality and student outcomes.
