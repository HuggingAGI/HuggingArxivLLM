> 多模态学习作为人工智能中发展迅猛的领域，旨在通过整合与分析文本、图像、音频及视频等各类数据，构建更全能且强大的系统。受人类通过多种感官吸收信息这一能力的启发，此方法促成了文本转视频、视觉问答及图像配文等应用。本综述着重阐述了支持多模态语言模型（MLLMs）的数据集的最新进展。大规模多模态数据集意义重大，因其能对这些模型进行全面的测试和训练。该研究考查了多种数据集，涵盖训练、特定领域任务及实际应用等方面，强调了基准数据集对于评估模型在各类场景中的性能、可扩展性和适用性的关键作用。鉴于多模态学习不断变化，克服这些障碍将助力人工智能研究与应用迈上新台阶。

> Multimodal learning, a rapidly evolving field in artificial intelligence, seeks to construct more versatile and robust systems by integrating and analyzing diverse types of data, including text, images, audio, and video. Inspired by the human ability to assimilate information through many senses, this method enables applications such as text-to-video conversion, visual question answering, and image captioning. Recent developments in datasets that support multimodal language models (MLLMs) are highlighted in this overview. Large-scale multimodal datasets are essential because they allow for thorough testing and training of these models. With an emphasis on their contributions to the discipline, the study examines a variety of datasets, including those for training, domain-specific tasks, and real-world applications. It also emphasizes how crucial benchmark datasets are for assessing models' performance in a range of scenarios, scalability, and applicability. Since multimodal learning is always changing, overcoming these obstacles will help AI research and applications reach new heights.
