> DisEmbed: Transforming Disease Understanding through Embeddings

# 摘要

> 医疗领域广阔多样，现有嵌入模型多聚焦于通用医疗应用，但因广泛泛化，难以深入理解疾病。为此，我推出DisEmbed，一款专注于疾病的嵌入模型。DisEmbed在精心策划的合成数据集上训练，涵盖疾病描述、症状及疾病相关问答对，特别适合疾病相关任务。通过疾病特定数据集和三重评估方法，DisEmbed在基准测试中表现优异，尤其在识别疾病相关上下文和区分相似疾病方面。这使得DisEmbed在疾病特定用例中极具价值，尤其在检索增强生成（RAG）任务中表现尤为突出。

> The medical domain is vast and diverse, with many existing embedding models focused on general healthcare applications. However, these models often struggle to capture a deep understanding of diseases due to their broad generalization across the entire medical field. To address this gap, I present DisEmbed, a disease-focused embedding model. DisEmbed is trained on a synthetic dataset specifically curated to include disease descriptions, symptoms, and disease-related Q\&A pairs, making it uniquely suited for disease-related tasks. For evaluation, I benchmarked DisEmbed against existing medical models using disease-specific datasets and the triplet evaluation method. My results demonstrate that DisEmbed outperforms other models, particularly in identifying disease-related contexts and distinguishing between similar diseases. This makes DisEmbed highly valuable for disease-specific use cases, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where its performance is particularly robust.
