> An Overview and Discussion on Using Large Language Models for Implementation Generation of Solutions to Open-Ended Problems

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型为设计自动化实现生成方法提供了新机遇，这些方法能够解决传统方法难以应对的问题。传统方法依赖算法规范，且仅能利用静态领域知识，如性能指标和基础构建块库。而大型语言模型则能支持创建新方法，助力解决开放式问题，如问题定义、探索解决方案、特征细化与组合、高级实现评估及应对意外情况。本报告总结了当前在大型语言模型领域的研究进展，涵盖模型提示、强化学习和检索增强生成等技术，并探讨了未来的研究方向。

> Large Language Models offer new opportunities to devise automated implementation generation methods that can tackle problem solving activities beyond traditional methods, which require algorithmic specifications and can use only static domain knowledge, like performance metrics and libraries of basic building blocks. Large Language Models could support creating new methods to support problem solving activities for open-ended problems, like problem framing, exploring possible solving approaches, feature elaboration and combination, more advanced implementation assessment, and handling unexpected situations. This report summarized the current work on Large Language Models, including model prompting, Reinforcement Learning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Future research requirements were also discussed.
