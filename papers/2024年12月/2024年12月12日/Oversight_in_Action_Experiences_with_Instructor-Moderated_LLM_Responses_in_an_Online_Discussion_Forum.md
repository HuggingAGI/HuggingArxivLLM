> Oversight in Action: Experiences with Instructor-Moderated LLM Responses in an Online Discussion Forum

# 摘要

> 将大型语言模型（LLMs）融入计算机教育，为学生的学习带来诸多潜在益处，文献中已有若干新颖的教学方法被报道。然而，LLMs 也带来了挑战，其中最常被提及的便是学生的过度依赖。由于 LLMs 随时能为学生提供即时帮助与解决方案，这一挑战愈发严峻，可能会削弱学生独立解决问题、诊断并解决错误的能力。由教师对 LLM 生成的内容进行监督能缓解此问题，可在实时学习情境中往往难以实现。在计算机教育中广泛使用的在线课堂讨论论坛为探索教师监督提供了契机，因其异步运行。与实时互动不同，讨论论坛的形式符合响应可能需要时间的预期，使得监督不仅可行，在教学上也颇为恰当。在这篇实践论文中，我们介绍了一个由教师掌控并融入在线讨论论坛的“机器人”模块的设计、部署与评估。该机器人协助教师为学生的问题生成草稿回复，这些回复在发布前会经过审查、修改与批准。关键特性包括能够利用课程材料、访问存档讨论以及匿名发布回复以鼓励开放参与。我们报告了在为期 12 周的面向二年级软件工程课程的面向对象编程中使用此工具的经历。教师的反馈表明该工具成功减轻了工作量，但也指出在处理复杂、依赖上下文的查询方面有待改进。我们报告了被认为最有益的功能，并提出了未来探索的方向。

> The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a `bot' module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.
