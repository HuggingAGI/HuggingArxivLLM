# 摘要

> 确定公司的可持续性影响是个极为复杂的课题，过去几年备受关注。当下，投资者很大程度上依赖知名评级机构给出的可持续性评级，来分析公司行为的负责程度。然而，这些评级近来因难以理解且几乎无法重现而饱受诟病。
    探寻公司可持续性实践的独立途径在于丰富的新闻文章数据。本文中，我们探索了别样的方法来明确公司在可持续性领域的关键机遇与挑战。我们呈现了一个新的数据集，涵盖超过 84 万篇新闻文章，是 2023 年 1 月至 2024 年 9 月间为德国主要公司收集的。通过运用自然语言处理技术的组合，我们先识别相关文章，接着进行总结，并借助大型语言模型（LLMs）提取其与可持续性相关的情感和方面。另外，我们对获取的数据进行评估，确定 LLM 生成的答案是准确的。我们在 https://github.com/Bailefan/Nano-ESG 发布了这两个数据集。

> Determining the sustainability impact of companies is a highly complex subject which has garnered more and more attention over the past few years. Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts. However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce.
  An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain. We present a novel dataset of more than 840,000 news articles which were gathered for major German companies between January 2023 and September 2024. By applying a mixture of Natural Language Processing techniques, we first identify relevant articles, before summarizing them and extracting their sustainability-related sentiment and aspect using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we conduct an evaluation of the obtained data and determine that the LLM-produced answers are accurate. We release both datasets at https://github.com/Bailefan/Nano-ESG.
