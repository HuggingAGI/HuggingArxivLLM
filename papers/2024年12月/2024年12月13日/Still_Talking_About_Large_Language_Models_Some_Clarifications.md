# 摘要

> 我的论文《谈论大型语言模型》多次被误解为是在倡导对大型语言模型持简化主义立场。但这并非论文本意，我也不认同此类立场。这则简短的笔记将该论文置于一个更宏大的哲学项目背景之中，此项目关注的是（错误）用词而非形而上学，遵循了维特根斯坦后期作品的精神。

> My paper "Talking About Large Language Models" has more than once been interpreted as advocating a reductionist stance towards large language models. But the paper was not intended that way, and I do not endorse such positions. This short note situates the paper in the context of a larger philosophical project that is concerned with the (mis)use of words rather than metaphysics, in the spirit of Wittgenstein's later writing.
