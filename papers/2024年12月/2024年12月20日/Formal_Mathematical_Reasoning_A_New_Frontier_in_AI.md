> Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier in AI

# 摘要

> AI 用于数学（AI4Math）不仅充满智趣，而且对科学、工程等领域中由 AI 驱动的发现意义重大。AI4Math 的诸多努力借鉴了自然语言处理的技术，尤其是在精心整理的数学文本数据集上训练大型语言模型。作为一种互补但探索较少的途径，形式数学推理基于证明助手等形式系统，能够验证推理的正确性并提供自动反馈。在这篇立场文件中，我们力挺形式数学推理，认为它对于推动 AI4Math 更上一层楼不可或缺。近年来，我们见证了使用 AI 进行形式推理的稳步进展，涵盖定理证明和自动形式化等核心任务，以及可验证的代码生成和硬件设计等新兴应用。然而，要让 AI 真正精通数学并产生更广泛的影响，仍有重大挑战亟待解决。我们总结了现有成果，探讨了开放挑战，并构想了衡量未来成功的关键里程碑。在形式数学推理的这一转折点，我们呼吁研究界携手共进，推动该领域的变革性发展。

> AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) is not only intriguing intellectually but also crucial for AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond. Extensive efforts on AI4Math have mirrored techniques in NLP, in particular, training large language models on carefully curated math datasets in text form. As a complementary yet less explored avenue, formal mathematical reasoning is grounded in formal systems such as proof assistants, which can verify the correctness of reasoning and provide automatic feedback. In this position paper, we advocate for formal mathematical reasoning and argue that it is indispensable for advancing AI4Math to the next level. In recent years, we have seen steady progress in using AI to perform formal reasoning, including core tasks such as theorem proving and autoformalization, as well as emerging applications such as verifiable generation of code and hardware designs. However, significant challenges remain to be solved for AI to truly master mathematics and achieve broader impact. We summarize existing progress, discuss open challenges, and envision critical milestones to measure future success. At this inflection point for formal mathematical reasoning, we call on the research community to come together to drive transformative advancements in this field.
