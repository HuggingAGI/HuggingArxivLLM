> Personalized Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey

# 摘要

> 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）凭借其卓越的性能以及整合文本、图像、音频等多种数据模态以高精度完成复杂任务的能力，重要性日益凸显。本文对个性化多模态大型语言模型展开了全面调研，着重探讨其架构、训练方法和应用。我们提出了一种直观的分类法，用于对将 MLLMs 个性化给个体用户的技术进行归类，并据此展开讨论。此外，我们论述了在恰当情形下如何对这些技术进行组合或调整，突显了其优点和内在原理。我们还对现有研究中所探究的个性化任务进行了简要总结，并列出了常用的评估指标。另外，我们汇总了对个性化 MLLMs 进行基准测试有用的数据集。最后，我们勾勒出了关键的开放性挑战。此次调研旨在为致力于了解和推动个性化多模态大型语言模型发展的研究人员和从业者提供宝贵的参考资料。

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become increasingly important due to their state-of-the-art performance and ability to integrate multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to perform complex tasks with high accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on personalized multimodal large language models, focusing on their architecture, training methods, and applications. We propose an intuitive taxonomy for categorizing the techniques used to personalize MLLMs to individual users, and discuss the techniques accordingly. Furthermore, we discuss how such techniques can be combined or adapted when appropriate, highlighting their advantages and underlying rationale. We also provide a succinct summary of personalization tasks investigated in existing research, along with the evaluation metrics commonly used. Additionally, we summarize the datasets that are useful for benchmarking personalized MLLMs. Finally, we outline critical open challenges. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and advance the development of personalized multimodal large language models.
