# 摘要

> 这篇观点文章旨在勾勒出将前沿预测语言模型与脑机接口（BCI）相融合的现状及未来发展走向。首先，对早期及近期的语言模型（从自然语言处理（NLP）模型到当下的大型语言模型（LLM））进行了综合概述，这些模型在不同程度上优化了预测写作系统。其次，总结了此前将语言模型与BCI相整合的实现情况。接着，阐述了少数有关探究LLM与BCI拼写器可能组合的初步研究，以有效支持快速通信与控制。最后，探讨了将LLM与BCI系统完全融合所面临的当前挑战与限制。近期研究表明，LLM与BCI的结合有望极大改善运动或语言障碍患者以及健康个体中的人机交互。特别是像GPT这种借助并行化、通过预训练和微调来学习的预训练自回归转换器模型，相较于此前结合更简单语言模型的系统，有望大幅提升用于通信的BCI性能。实际上，在众多模型中，GPT-2被证明是融入BCI的极佳选择，不过测试仅在模拟对话中开展，而非在真实的BCI场景中进行。展望未来，LLM与先进BCI系统的全面融合或许会引领朝着快速、高效和用户自适应的神经技术的巨大飞跃。

> This perspective article aims at providing an outline of the state of the art and future developments towards the integration of cutting-edge predictive language models with BCI. A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology.
