> Question Answering for Decisionmaking in Green Building Design: A Multimodal Data Reasoning Method Driven by Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 近年来，绿色建筑在应对能源消耗和环境问题上的关键作用已广受认同。研究显示，在早期设计阶段能实现超 40%的潜在能源节省。所以，基于建模和性能模拟的绿色建筑设计决策（DGBD）对降低建筑能源成本极为重要。然而，绿色建筑领域包含众多专业知识，这带来了高昂的学习成本，致使决策效率不高。众多研究已在该领域应用了人工智能（AI）方法。基于此前的研究，本研究创新地把大型语言模型与 DGBD 相融合，创建了 GreenQA，这是一个用于多模态数据推理的问答框架。借助检索增强生成、思维链和函数调用等方法，GreenQA 实现了多模态问答，涵盖天气数据分析与可视化、绿色建筑案例检索以及知识查询。另外，本研究通过 GreenQA 网络平台开展了用户调查。结果表明，96%的用户觉得该平台有助于提升设计效率。本研究不但有力支持了 DGBD，还为人工智能辅助设计带来了启发。

> In recent years, the critical role of green buildings in addressing energy consumption and environmental issues has become widely acknowledged. Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency. This study not only effectively supports DGBD but also provides inspiration for AI-assisted design.
