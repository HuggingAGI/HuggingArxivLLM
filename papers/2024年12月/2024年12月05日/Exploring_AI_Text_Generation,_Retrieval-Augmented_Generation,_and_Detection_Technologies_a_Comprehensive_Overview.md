# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）发展迅速，造就了诸如大型语言模型（LLMs）之类强大的文本生成模型，广泛应用于各类场景。然而，对于人工智能生成内容的顾虑，像原创性、偏见、错误信息及责任等问题，愈发凸显。此文对人工智能文本生成器（AITGs）予以全面阐述，着重于其演进、能力及伦理影响。文中还引入了检索增强生成（RAG）这一最新手段，它通过融合动态信息检索，提升了文本生成的上下文相关性与准确性。RAG解决了传统模型的关键局限，比如对静态知识的依赖以及处理现实数据时可能出现的不准确。另外，文章回顾了有助于区分人工智能生成文本与人类编写内容的检测工具，并探讨了这些技术带来的伦理挑战。文章探索了提高检测准确率、支持合乎伦理的人工智能发展以及增强可访问性的未来方向。通过这些探讨，本文为在内容创作中更负责、更可靠地运用人工智能作出了贡献。

> The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of powerful text generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), which are widely used for diverse applications. However, concerns surrounding AI-generated content, including issues of originality, bias, misinformation, and accountability, have become increasingly prominent. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of AI text generators (AITGs), focusing on their evolution, capabilities, and ethical implications. This paper also introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a recent approach that improves the contextual relevance and accuracy of text generation by integrating dynamic information retrieval. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional models, including their reliance on static knowledge and potential inaccuracies in handling real-world data. Additionally, the paper reviews detection tools that help differentiate AI-generated text from human-written content and discusses the ethical challenges these technologies pose. The paper explores future directions for improving detection accuracy, supporting ethical AI development, and increasing accessibility. The paper contributes to a more responsible and reliable use of AI in content creation through these discussions.
