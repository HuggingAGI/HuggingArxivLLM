# 摘要

> 冠状动脉疾病（CAD）和冠状动脉微血管疾病（CMD）会致使心肌供血不足，全球数百万人受其影响。冠状动脉造影作为最常用的成像方式之一，能提供有助于诊断这些疾病的宝贵信息。然而，在当下的临床实践中，这些优点未被充分理解和运用。本研究开发并校准了一个 3D - 0D 耦合多物理计算流体动力学（CFD）模型，用于模拟和更好地理解临床冠状动脉造影时造影剂的注射与冲洗过程。引入造影剂强度曲线（CIP）来捕捉冠状动脉造影数据的动态变化。此外，还开展了敏感性研究，以评估各种冠状动脉模型参数对 CIP 的影响。结果显示，校准后的 3D - 0D 耦合多物理模型具有生理意义，能得出准确的血流动力学结果。敏感性研究进一步表明，阻力对 CIP 的影响大于电容，较高的阻力会增强这种影响。

> Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) can lead to insufficient blood flow to the myocardium, affecting millions of people globally. Coronary angiography, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities, offers valuable information that assists in diagnosing these diseases. However, these benefits are not fully understood or utilized in current clinical practice. In this study, a 3D-0D coupled multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and calibrated to simulate and better understand the process of contrast injection and washout during clinical angiography. A contrast intensity profile (CIP) was introduced to capture the dynamics of coronary angiography data. Additionally, a sensitivity study was conducted to assess the influence of various coronary artery model parameters on CIP. The results demonstrate that the calibrated 3D-0D coupled multi-physics models are physiologically meaningful and produce accurate hemodynamic results. The sensitivity study further reveals that resistance has a greater impact on CIP than capacitance, with higher resistance amplifying this effect.
