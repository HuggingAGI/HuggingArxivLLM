> 监测疲劳对于提升安全性极为重要，尤其是对于那些长时间轮班或在高要求工作场所工作的人。诸如健身追踪器和智能手表之类的可穿戴技术的发展，让实时连续分析生理信号以确定人的疲劳程度成为可能。这有助于及时洞察与疲劳相关的危险。本综述聚焦于用于疲劳检测的可穿戴技术与人工智能（AI）的集成，遵循 PRISMA 原则。在系统综述过程中，分析了那些使用信号处理方法从生理数据（如心电图、肌电图和脑电图等）中提取相关内容的研究。接着，为了找出疲劳模式和即将疲劳的指标，运用机器学习和深度学习模型对这些特征进行了检测。事实证明，可穿戴技术和前沿的 AI 方法能够通过多模态数据分析精准识别疲劳。通过整合多个来源的数据，信息融合技术提升了疲劳评估的精度和可靠性。评估中留意到人工智能驱动的信号分析的重大进展，这应当能改进实时疲劳监测，同时减少干扰。由 AI 和多源数据融合驱动的可穿戴解决方案，为工作场所和其他关键环境中的实时疲劳监测提供了有力选择。这些进展为该领域的更多改进开辟了道路，并为提高安全性和降低与疲劳相关的危险提供了有用的工具。

> Monitoring fatigue is essential for improving safety, particularly for people who work long shifts or in high-demand workplaces. The development of wearable technologies, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, has made it possible to continuously analyze physiological signals in real-time to determine a person level of exhaustion. This has allowed for timely insights into preventing hazards associated with fatigue. This review focuses on wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) integration for tiredness detection, adhering to the PRISMA principles. Studies that used signal processing methods to extract pertinent aspects from physiological data, such as ECG, EMG, and EEG, among others, were analyzed as part of the systematic review process. Then, to find patterns of weariness and indicators of impending fatigue, these features were examined using machine learning and deep learning models. It was demonstrated that wearable technology and cutting-edge AI methods could accurately identify weariness through multi-modal data analysis. By merging data from several sources, information fusion techniques enhanced the precision and dependability of fatigue evaluation. Significant developments in AI-driven signal analysis were noted in the assessment, which should improve real-time fatigue monitoring while requiring less interference. Wearable solutions powered by AI and multi-source data fusion present a strong option for real-time tiredness monitoring in the workplace and other crucial environments. These developments open the door for more improvements in this field and offer useful tools for enhancing safety and reducing fatigue-related hazards.
