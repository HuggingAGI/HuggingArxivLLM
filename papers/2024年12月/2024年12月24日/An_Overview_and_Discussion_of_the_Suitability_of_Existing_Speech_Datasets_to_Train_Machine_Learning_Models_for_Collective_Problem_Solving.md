# 摘要

> 本报告阐述了现有数据集在设计新的机器学习模型、决策方法和分析算法以提升协作问题解决能力方面的适用性，接着罗列了未来设计数据集的需求。假定问题解决由约三、四名成员组成的团队来执行，他们相互交流。数据集由这类团队的语音记录构成。特征描述方法依据的是能捕捉认知、社交及情感活动和状况的指标。报告还呈现了对为口语理解（这一与协作问题解决有一定相似性的研究领域）所开发的大量数据集的分析。

> This report characterized the suitability of existing datasets for devising new Machine Learning models, decision making methods, and analysis algorithms to improve Collaborative Problem Solving and then enumerated requirements for future datasets to be devised. Problem solving was assumed to be performed in teams of about three, four members, which talked to each other. A dataset consists of the speech recordings of such teams. The characterization methodology was based on metrics that capture cognitive, social, and emotional activities and situations. The report presented the analysis of a large group of datasets developed for Spoken Language Understanding, a research area with some similarity to Collaborative Problem Solving.
