# 摘要

> 随着社会变化的加快，心身疾病的发生率大幅上升，成为全球健康问题的重大挑战。这就需要创新的知识体系和分析方法来助力诊断与治疗。在此，我们构建了本体模型和实体类型，运用 BERT 模型及经 LoRA 调优的 LLM 进行命名实体识别，构建了含 9668 个三元组的知识图谱。接着，通过剖析疾病、症状和药物模块间的网络距离，发现疾病间网络距离越近，其临床表现、治疗方式和心理机制的相似性越大，症状间距离越近，则越可能同时出现。最后，对比接近度 d 和接近度 z 分数，表明初级诊断关系中的症状 - 疾病对关联更强，参考价值高于诊断关系中的。研究成果揭示了疾病、并发症状和治疗策略相似性之间的潜在关联，为心身疾病的诊治提供了新视角，也为未来的心理健康研究和实践提供了宝贵信息。

> As social changes accelerate, the incidence of psychosomatic disorders has significantly increased, becoming a major challenge in global health issues. This necessitates an innovative knowledge system and analytical methods to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we establish the ontology model and entity types, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition, constructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the network distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score, it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential connections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in treatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental health research and practice.
