> Understanding Cross-Lingual Alignment -- A Survey

# 摘要

> 跨语言对齐，即多语言模型中不同语言间表征的有意义相似性，近年来成为研究的焦点。本文梳理了提升跨语言对齐的技术文献，归纳方法分类，并概括了该领域的深刻见解。我们探讨了跨语言对齐的多种理解及其存在的限制。通过定性分析众多研究论文成果，我们进一步讨论了这些见解如何广泛应用于编码器模型、编码器-解码器模型，乃至仅解码器模型，并强调在通用语言信息与特定语言信息间找到有效平衡的重要性。

> Cross-lingual alignment, the meaningful similarity of representations across languages in multilingual language models, has been an active field of research in recent years. We survey the literature of techniques to improve cross-lingual alignment, providing a taxonomy of methods and summarising insights from throughout the field. We present different understandings of cross-lingual alignment and their limitations. We provide a qualitative summary of results from a large number of surveyed papers. Finally, we discuss how these insights may be applied not only to encoder models, where this topic has been heavily studied, but also to encoder-decoder or even decoder-only models, and argue that an effective trade-off between language-neutral and language-specific information is key.
