> Building A Knowledge Graph to Enrich ChatGPT Responses in Manufacturing Service Discovery

# 摘要

> 对制造系统集成商而言，发掘新的制造伙伴至关重要，这有助于在全球经济中提高应变能力和通过供应链多元化降低风险。尽管先进的大型语言模型因其在众多知识领域提供全面而精准回答的能力而备受瞩目，但在处理特定领域问题，尤其是制造服务发现方面，其准确性和完整性仍有待提高。本研究旨在探索结合知识图谱与ChatGPT的潜力，以优化客户识别小型制造企业的流程。我们提出了一种新方法，通过整合自下而上的本体论与前沿的机器学习模型，从众多结构化与非结构化数据源中构建制造服务知识图谱，其中包括北美地区众多小型制造商的数字足迹。该知识图谱及其学习到的图嵌入向量，能够有效应对数字供应链网络中的复杂查询，提供更可靠的响应和更高的可解释性。这一方法可扩展至数百万实体，形成全球性的制造服务知识图谱网络，有望连接不同行业、政治边界和商业领域的知识图谱。目前，本研究开发的数据集已公开，覆盖超过13,000家制造商的网络链接、服务、认证信息及地理位置等实体类型。

> Sourcing and identification of new manufacturing partners is crucial for manufacturing system integrators to enhance agility and reduce risk through supply chain diversification in the global economy. The advent of advanced large language models has captured significant interest, due to their ability to generate comprehensive and articulate responses across a wide range of knowledge domains. However, the system often falls short in accuracy and completeness when responding to domain-specific inquiries, particularly in areas like manufacturing service discovery. This research explores the potential of leveraging Knowledge Graphs in conjunction with ChatGPT to streamline the process for prospective clients in identifying small manufacturing enterprises. In this study, we propose a method that integrates bottom-up ontology with advanced machine learning models to develop a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph from an array of structured and unstructured data sources, including the digital footprints of small-scale manufacturers throughout North America. The Knowledge Graph and the learned graph embedding vectors are leveraged to tackle intricate queries within the digital supply chain network, responding with enhanced reliability and greater interpretability. The approach highlighted is scalable to millions of entities that can be distributed to form a global Manufacturing Service Knowledge Network Graph that can potentially interconnect multiple types of Knowledge Graphs that span industry sectors, geopolitical boundaries, and business domains. The dataset developed for this study, now publicly accessible, encompasses more than 13,000 manufacturers' weblinks, manufacturing services, certifications, and location entity types.
