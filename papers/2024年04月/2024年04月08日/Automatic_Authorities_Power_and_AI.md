> Automatic Authorities: Power and AI

# 摘要

> 人工智能的飞速进步与历史上最具影响力的企业崛起相遇，与此同时，自由主义国家的影响力减弱，人们越来越多地受到自动化系统所行使权力的支配。机器学习及相关计算技术已成为关键政府服务的基石，它们在新兴的算法市场中连接消费者与生产者，左右着我们从投票到疫苗接种的信息获取途径，以及言论的放大、抑制或限制。基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的新产品将深刻改变我们的经济和政治生活。自动权威，即通过决定我们能知晓什么、能拥有什么以及我们的选择范围来对我们施加权力的自动化计算系统，正日益崛起。面对这一趋势，研究人工智能及其相关技术社会影响的学者们提倡，应从关注如何让人工智能系统更有益或公平，转向批判性地分析这些新兴的权力关系。然而，权力无处不在，并非全然负面。我们应基于何种理由反对新的或更强化的权力关系？又应如何证明这些权力关系的合理性？本文介绍了用于提出这些问题的哲学基础，并尝试给出初步的回答。文章首先界定了权力的概念，聚焦于某些主体塑造他人生活的能力。接着探讨了人工智能如何促进和加强这种对权力的理解，并概述了权力带来的三个问题及其解决途径。特别强调，要证明权力的合法性，不仅要满足实质性的理由，还必须符合正当权威的标准和程序的合法性。我们需要了解权力可以用于何种目的，以及它的行使方式和行使者。

> As rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence and the rise of some of history's most potent corporations meet the diminished neoliberal state, people are increasingly subject to power exercised by means of automated systems. Machine learning and related computational technologies now underpin vital government services. They connect consumers and producers in new algorithmic markets. They determine how we find out about everything from how to vote to where to get vaccinated, and whose speech is amplified, reduced, or restricted. And a new wave of products based on Large Language Models (LLMs) will further transform our economic and political lives. Automatic Authorities are automated computational systems used to exercise power over us by determining what we may know, what we may have, and what our options will be. In response to their rise, scholars working on the societal impacts of AI and related technologies have advocated shifting attention from how to make AI systems beneficial or fair towards a critical analysis of these new power relations. But power is everywhere, and is not necessarily bad. On what basis should we object to new or intensified power relations, and what can be done to justify them? This paper introduces the philosophical materials with which to formulate these questions, and offers preliminary answers. It starts by pinning down the concept of power, focusing on the ability that some agents have to shape others' lives. It then explores how AI enables and intensifies the exercise of power so understood, and sketches three problems with power and three ways to solve those problems. It emphasises, in particular, that justifying power requires more than satisfying substantive justificatory criteria; standards of proper authority and procedural legitimacy must also be met. We need to know not only what power may be used for, but how it may be used, and by whom.
