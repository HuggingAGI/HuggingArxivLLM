# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步，正引领法律领域自然语言处理任务经历一场深刻的变革。LLMs在法律界的应用日益显现其独特价值，同时也带来了诸多挑战。本调查深入分析了LLMs与法律体系的互动，例如在法律文本解析、案例检索和分析等任务上的运用。同时，本调查着重指出了LLMs在法律实践中面临的挑战，如偏见、可解释性和伦理问题，并探讨了研究者如何应对这些挑战。调查还展示了为不同法律体系量身打造的微调法律LLMs的最新进展，以及多语言环境下用于微调LLMs的法律数据集。此外，本调查还为未来的研究和开发指明了方向。

> With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a profound transformation occurring in the realm of natural language processing tasks within the legal domain. The capabilities of LLMs are increasingly demonstrating unique roles in the legal sector, bringing both distinctive benefits and various challenges. This survey delves into the synergy between LLMs and the legal system, such as their applications in tasks like legal text comprehension, case retrieval, and analysis. Furthermore, this survey highlights key challenges faced by LLMs in the legal domain, including bias, interpretability, and ethical considerations, as well as how researchers are addressing these issues. The survey showcases the latest advancements in fine-tuned legal LLMs tailored for various legal systems, along with legal datasets available for fine-tuning LLMs in various languages. Additionally, it proposes directions for future research and development.
