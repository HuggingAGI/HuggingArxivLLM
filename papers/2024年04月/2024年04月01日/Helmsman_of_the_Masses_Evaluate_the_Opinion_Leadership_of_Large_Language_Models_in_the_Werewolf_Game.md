> Helmsman of the Masses? Evaluate the Opinion Leadership of Large Language Models in the Werewolf Game

# 摘要

> 在社交推理游戏的舞台上，大型语言模型（LLMs）展现了令人印象深刻的策略性行为。然而，LLM代理所扮演的意见领袖角色，其重要性常被忽略，这在多代理系统和人机互动的实际运用中尤为关键。意见领袖是指那些能显著影响社交群体中他人信仰和行为的人。本研究以狼人游戏为实验场，通过警长这一角色来检验LLM的意见领导力，警长在游戏中负责梳理论点和提供决策建议，充当意见领袖的合适代表。我们构建了一个框架，创新性地设计了两个评价指标，分别衡量意见领袖的可信度和对其他玩家决策的影响力。通过大量实验对不同规模的LLM进行了评估，同时收集了狼人游戏问答数据集（WWQA），以加深LLM对游戏规则的理解，并引入人类玩家进行深入分析。研究结果显示，狼人游戏是检验LLM意见领导力的有效平台，但只有少数LLM展现出了意见领袖的潜质。

> Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited memorable strategic behaviors in social deductive games. However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game features the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics for evaluation based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership.
