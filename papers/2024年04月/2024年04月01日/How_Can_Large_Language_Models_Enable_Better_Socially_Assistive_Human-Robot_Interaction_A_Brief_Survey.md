# 摘要

> 社交辅助机器人（SARs）已成功地为老年人、自闭症儿童和心理健康面临挑战的个体等特殊需求群体提供了定制化的认知与情感支持。这些研究成果表明，SARs有望提供家庭支持，与心理健康专家提供的临床干预相辅相成，提高干预的效果和可及性。尽管如此，SARs在实现与人同等水平的社会智能和效能方面仍面临诸多技术难题。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，SAR领域的新应用前景愈发广阔，有望极大提升SARs的现有功能。然而，融合LLMs也引入了新的挑战和伦理考量，这些问题尚待解决，以确保这些高级系统的安全应用。本文将简要探讨LLMs在SAR技术中的应用，并分析其在解决SARs面临的三大技术难题——自然语言对话、多模态理解和以LLMs为机器人策略——时的潜在优势和风险。

> Socially assistive robots (SARs) have shown great success in providing personalized cognitive-affective support for user populations with special needs such as older adults, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and individuals with mental health challenges. The large body of work on SAR demonstrates its potential to provide at-home support that complements clinic-based interventions delivered by mental health professionals, making these interventions more effective and accessible. However, there are still several major technical challenges that hinder SAR-mediated interactions and interventions from reaching human-level social intelligence and efficacy. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs), there is an increased potential for novel applications within the field of SAR that can significantly expand the current capabilities of SARs. However, incorporating LLMs introduces new risks and ethical concerns that have not yet been encountered, and must be carefully be addressed to safely deploy these more advanced systems. In this work, we aim to conduct a brief survey on the use of LLMs in SAR technologies, and discuss the potentials and risks of applying LLMs to the following three major technical challenges of SAR: 1) natural language dialog; 2) multimodal understanding; 3) LLMs as robot policies.
