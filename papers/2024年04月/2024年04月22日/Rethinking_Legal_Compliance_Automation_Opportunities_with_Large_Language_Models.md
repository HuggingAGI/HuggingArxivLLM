> Rethinking Legal Compliance Automation: Opportunities with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 随着软件系统在遵守法规方面的要求日益严格，自动化合规性分析变得尤为关键。尽管需求工程领域在法律合规性分析上取得了进展，但创建精确且普遍适用的自动化合规解决方案仍面临挑战。本文指出了现有方法的局限，并讨论了如何通过采用基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的新自动化策略来克服这些障碍，进而开拓新的可能。我们主张，法律文本的分析不应仅限于句子层面，而应扩展到更宽广的上下文。此外，法律文本分析的方式也应从传统的分类和信息抽取，转变为能够提供准确结果并给出合理解释的端到端策略。我们介绍了一种新的合规性分析方法，旨在克服现有局限，并概述了我们的评估计划。基于必须遵循通用数据保护条例（GDPR）的数据处理协议（DPAs），我们进行了初步评估，结果表明，新方法在提高准确性的同时，还能为合规决策提供充分的理由。

> As software-intensive systems face growing pressure to comply with laws and regulations, providing automated support for compliance analysis has become paramount. Despite advances in the Requirements Engineering (RE) community on legal compliance analysis, important obstacles remain in developing accurate and generalizable compliance automation solutions. This paper highlights some observed limitations of current approaches and examines how adopting new automation strategies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these shortcomings and open up fresh opportunities. Specifically, we argue that the examination of (textual) legal artifacts should, first, employ a broader context than sentences, which have widely been used as the units of analysis in past research. Second, the mode of analysis with legal artifacts needs to shift from classification and information extraction to more end-to-end strategies that are not only accurate but also capable of providing explanation and justification. We present a compliance analysis approach designed to address these limitations. We further outline our evaluation plan for the approach and provide preliminary evaluation results based on data processing agreements (DPAs) that must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our initial findings suggest that our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements and, at the same time, provides justification for compliance decisions.
