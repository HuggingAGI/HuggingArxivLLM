> Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）正逐步融入搜索引擎，以提供个性化的自然语言回答，满足用户查询需求。消费者也越来越依靠这些模型来做出迅速且简便的购买选择。本研究探讨了LLMs的推荐是否可被操控，以提升产品曝光度。我们发现，通过在产品页面巧妙地加入一段战略性文本（STS），能大幅提高该产品成为LLM首要推荐的几率。通过构建一个虚拟的咖啡机清单，并对两个目标产品进行分析，我们发现STS显著提升了它们的曝光率，让它们更有可能成为推荐榜首。这种对LLM搜索结果的操控潜力，不仅为商家带来了竞争优势，也可能对市场公平竞争造成影响。正如SEO改变了网页优化以提升搜索排名的策略，对LLM推荐的干预也可能深刻地改变AI驱动搜索服务的内容优化方式。相关实验代码已公开在 https://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer。

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries. Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.
