> Accuracy of a Large Language Model in Distinguishing Anti- And Pro-vaccination Messages on Social Media: The Case of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination

# 摘要

> 研究目标。疫苗接种激起了公众的多元看法，社交媒体成为健康话题讨论的关键平台。人工智能技术，尤其是大型语言模型（LLM），为我们深入探究公众讨论提供了新机遇。本研究旨在评估基于LLM的ChatGPT服务在情感分析方面的准确性，以识别人们对HPV疫苗的不同态度。研究方法。我们从Facebook和Twitter收集了1000条与HPV疫苗相关的社交媒体信息，分别代表长文本和短文本格式。这些信息输入LLM后，生成多个响应实例，包含分类结果。准确性通过机器判断与人工判断的一致程度来衡量，分数介于0到1之间。研究结果显示，当利用20个响应实例确定机器决策时，准确度相当高：反对和支持疫苗接种的长文本信息分别为.882和.750，短文本信息分别为.773和.723。即便只使用三个或一个实例，准确性下降并不显著。然而，对于长文本信息，模型在识别支持疫苗接种的内容时准确率明显低于反对疫苗接种的内容。研究结论。ChatGPT在分析社交媒体上的HPV疫苗公众意见方面具有潜力，但深入了解语言模型在特定公共卫生场景下的特点和局限同样重要。

> Objective. Vaccination has engendered a spectrum of public opinions, with social media acting as a crucial platform for health-related discussions. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), offers a novel opportunity to efficiently investigate public discourses. This research assesses the accuracy of ChatGPT, a widely used and freely available service built upon an LLM, for sentiment analysis to discern different stances toward Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods. Messages related to HPV vaccination were collected from social media supporting different message formats: Facebook (long format) and Twitter (short format). A selection of 1,000 human-evaluated messages was input into the LLM, which generated multiple response instances containing its classification results. Accuracy was measured for each message as the level of concurrence between human and machine decisions, ranging between 0 and 1. Results. Average accuracy was notably high when 20 response instances were used to determine the machine decision of each message: .882 (SE = .021) and .750 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination long-form; .773 (SE = .027) and .723 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination short-form, respectively. Using only three or even one instance did not lead to a severe decrease in accuracy. However, for long-form messages, the language model exhibited significantly lower accuracy in categorizing pro-vaccination messages than anti-vaccination ones. Conclusions. ChatGPT shows potential in analyzing public opinions on HPV vaccination using social media content. However, understanding the characteristics and limitations of a language model within specific public health contexts remains imperative.
