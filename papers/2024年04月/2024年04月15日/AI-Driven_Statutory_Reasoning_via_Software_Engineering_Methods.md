> 随着生成性人工智能（GenAI）技术的兴起，如预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs），计算法学迎来了新的探索领域。AI在自动化法规和合同法中的规则推理方面展现出巨大潜力。尽管这些推理方法过去多依赖于自然语言处理（NLP）和形式逻辑的传统技术，但现代解决方案更多地借助LLMs的力量，尽管它们尚未达到完善。GenAI技术让自然语言文档可以被视为基于事实计算结果的程序，这为使用软件工程领域的成熟技术来理解、调试、维护和修复这些文档提供了可能。本文探讨了自动化软件测试和程序分析的一些概念，这些概念在应用于AI分析法规和合同时，对计算法学可能具有重要价值。

> The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies such as pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has opened up new frontiers in computational law. An exciting area of development is the use of AI to automate the rule-based reasoning inherent in statutory and contract law. While this form of reasoning has long been studied using classical techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and formal logic, recent solutions increasingly make use of LLMs; though they are far from perfect.
  The advent of GenAI has made it possible to treat many of these natural language documents essentially as programs that compute a result given some set of facts. As such, it should be possible to understand, debug, maintain, evolve, and fix these documents using well-studied techniques from the field of software engineering. This article introduces several concepts of automated software testing and program analysis that could potentially be useful in computational law when applied to AI-driven analysis of statutes and contracts.
