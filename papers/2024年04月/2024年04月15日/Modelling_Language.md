> 本文论述了大型语言模型在扮演语言科学模型的角色上具有重要意义。语言学不仅需探讨语言能力背后的认知机制，也应深入理解语言作为一种独立的社会现象。认识到这一点后，大型语言模型的科学价值便显而易见。文章反驳了那些认为语言模型无法带来语言洞见的观点，并通过引用科学哲学的新近成果，阐释了大型语言模型如何充当科学模型的角色。

> This paper argues that large language models have a valuable scientific role to play in serving as scientific models of a language. Linguistic study should not only be concerned with the cognitive processes behind linguistic competence, but also with language understood as an external, social entity. Once this is recognized, the value of large language models as scientific models becomes clear. This paper defends this position against a number of arguments to the effect that language models provide no linguistic insight. It also draws upon recent work in philosophy of science to show how large language models could serve as scientific models.
