# 摘要

> 成人学习正日益被视为推动个人成长和社会前进的关键途径。尽管如此，成人学习者在追求学业的同时还需应对平衡工作与生活等多方面的挑战。通过收集他们的反馈，可以有效洞察他们的顾虑，并优化学习体验。社交网络作为成人学习者情感数据的宝库，为我们提供了实时的情感信息。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动化情感分析方面表现出色，但目前尚无专门针对成人学习进行精准情感理解的模型。本文介绍了A-Learn，这是一个通过结合成人学习领域的特定数据集来提升情感分析能力的定制化LLM。我们采集了社交网络上成人学习者的评论，并利用现有的LLM对每条评论进行情感标注，创建了适合成人学习的标记数据集。这些数据集随后用于定制A-Learn，以多个基础LLM为起点。实验研究表明，A-Learn在情感分析上展现出了竞争优势，准确度最高达91.3%，相较于基础LLM提升了20%。此外，A-Learn还被应用于词云分析，帮助我们识别出成人学习者的核心关切。本研究的成果强调了将机器学习技术与教育专长相结合，对于提升教学质量和创新教育方法的重要性，这些方法将为成人学习者带来实实在在的好处。

> Adult learning is increasingly recognized as a crucial way for personal development and societal progress. It however is challenging, and adult learners face unique challenges such as balancing education with other life responsibilities. Collecting feedback from adult learners is effective in understanding their concerns and improving learning experiences, and social networks provide a rich source of real-time sentiment data from adult learners. Machine learning technologies especially large language models (LLMs) perform well in automating sentiment analysis. However, none of such models is specialized for adult learning with accurate sentiment understanding. In this paper, we present A-Learn, which enhances adult learning sentiment analysis by customizing existing general-purpose LLMs with domain-specific datasets for adult learning. We collect adult learners' comments from social networks and label the sentiment of each comment with an existing LLM to form labelled datasets tailored for adult learning. The datasets are used to customize A-Learn from several base LLMs. We conducted experimental studies and the results reveal A-Learn's competitive sentiment analysis performance, achieving up to 91.3% accuracy with 20% improvement over the base LLM. A-Learn is also employed for word cloud analysis to identify key concerns of adult learners. The research outcome of this study highlights the importance of applying machine learning with educational expertise for teaching improvement and educational innovations that benefit adult learning and adult learners.
