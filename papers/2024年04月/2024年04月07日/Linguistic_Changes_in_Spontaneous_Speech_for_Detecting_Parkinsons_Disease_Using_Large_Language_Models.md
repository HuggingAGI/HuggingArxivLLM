> Linguistic Changes in Spontaneous Speech for Detecting Parkinsons Disease Using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 帕金森病，全球第二大常见神经退行性疾病，每年新增百万确诊案例。其症状复杂多变，使得疾病的检测和诊断充满挑战。值得注意的是，语言障碍往往在帕金森病的运动症状之前出现，这意味着基于语言的诊断方法可能对早期发现该病具有潜在价值。随着大型语言模型技术的飞速发展，我们有机会利用这些先进的模型，通过高维度的语言特征来提高帕金森病的检测准确率。最新研究表明，利用这些模型从自然语言中自动检测帕金森病的准确度可达73%，为疾病的早期诊断和治疗提供了新的可能性。

> Parkinsons disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with over ten million active cases worldwide and one million new diagnoses per year. Detecting and subsequently diagnosing the disease is challenging because of symptom heterogeneity with respect to complexity, as well as the type and timing of phenotypic manifestations. Typically, language impairment can present in the prodromal phase and precede motor symptoms suggesting that a linguistic-based approach could serve as a diagnostic method for incipient Parkinsons disease. Additionally, improved linguistic models may enhance other approaches through ensemble techniques. The field of large language models is advancing rapidly, presenting the opportunity to explore the use of these new models for detecting Parkinsons disease and to improve on current linguistic approaches with high-dimensional representations of linguistics. We evaluate the application of state-of-the-art large language models to detect Parkinsons disease automatically from spontaneous speech with up to 73% accuracy.
