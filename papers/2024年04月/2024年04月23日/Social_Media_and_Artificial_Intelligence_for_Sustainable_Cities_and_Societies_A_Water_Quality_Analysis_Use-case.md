> Social Media and Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Cities and Societies: A Water Quality Analysis Use-case

# 摘要

> 本研究着眼于水质分析这一紧迫的社会问题。水资源的供应与质量保证，对于社会的经济和社会发展至关重要，始终是公共机构关注的焦点。为保障水质，常采用离线和在线调查等不同监测评估方法，但这些方法存在诸如参与者数量有限、调查频率低等局限。本文提出了一种自然语言处理（NLP）框架，旨在自动搜集和分析社交媒体上的涉水帖子，以支持基于数据的决策制定。该框架包含文本分类和主题建模两个部分。在文本分类方面，我们设计了一个基于优势融合的框架，集成了多个大型语言模型（LLMs），并通过不同的权重选择和优化方法为这些模型分配权重。主题建模方面，我们利用BERTopic库挖掘涉水推文中的隐含主题模式。此外，我们还对来自世界各地不同地区和国家的推文进行了分析，以探讨全球性、区域性和特定国家的水资源问题。同时，我们收集并手动标注了一个大规模数据集，旨在推动未来在该领域的研究工作。

> This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis. Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities. To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used. However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys. In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions. The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling. For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs. In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets. We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns. We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic.
