> Performance of LLMs on Stochastic Modeling Operations Research Problems: From Theory to Practice

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个领域中展现出专家级别的能力，但它们在运筹学（OR）问题上的解题潜力仍有待挖掘。运筹学的核心任务是对现实世界问题或其语言描述建立的数学模型进行分析和优化，而随机建模作为其重要分支，通常涉及不确定性并需要运用概率、统计和随机过程等工具。本研究通过手动收集一组研究生水平的作业和博士资格考试题目，初步评估了LLMs在随机建模问题上的解题能力。我们进一步借助开源仿真优化库SimOpt，探究了LLMs在不确定性条件下的实际决策能力。研究发现，尽管在现实场景中可靠地自动化随机建模流程仍需大量工作，但当前最先进的LLMs在课堂和实际应用中均展现出了与人类专家相当的水平。这一发现凸显了构建能够辅助运筹学研究人员并借助自动化放大运筹学实际影响力的AI代理的潜力。

> Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.
