> Keeping Medical AI Healthy: A Review of Detection and Correction Methods for System Degradation

# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）正日益融入现代医疗领域，为临床决策提供了强有力的支撑。然而，在实际应用中，AI系统可能会随着时间推移出现性能下降，原因包括数据分布变化、患者特征改变、临床指南更新以及数据质量波动等因素。这些问题可能削弱模型的可靠性，引发安全隐忧，并增加预测不准确或不良结果的风险。本文前瞻性地探讨了如何监测和维护医疗AI系统的“健康”状态。我们强调了持续性能监测、早期退化检测以及有效自我修正机制的迫切需求。文章首先回顾了数据和模型层面导致性能退化的常见原因。随后，我们总结了检测数据和模型漂移的关键技术，并深入探讨了根本原因分析。此外，我们还综述了从模型重新训练到测试时自适应的修正策略。本文涵盖了传统机器学习模型和前沿大型语言模型（LLMs），揭示了它们的优缺点。最后，我们讨论了当前的技术挑战，并提出了未来的研究方向。这项研究旨在为开发可靠、稳健的医疗AI系统提供指导，使其能够在动态临床环境中实现安全的长期部署。

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality. These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the "health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.
