> SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida

# 摘要

> 复合洪水的预测是一项极具挑战性的任务，因其涉及气象、水文和海洋因素的复杂相互作用。随着全球气候变化加剧洪水风险，复合洪水的分析变得尤为重要。传统基于物理的方法，如HEC-RAS，常因效率低下而难以满足需求。机器学习在建模准确性和计算效率上展现出巨大潜力，但目前综合数据集的匮乏限制了系统性分析。现有的水资源数据集通常受限于监测站点稀疏和相关因素覆盖不全。为此，我们推出了SF2Bench，一个全面的南佛罗里达州复合洪水时间序列集合，整合了潮汐、降雨、地下水和人类管理活动（闸门和泵控制）四个关键因素。这一整合使我们能够更细致地分析这些驱动因素对复合洪水的个体贡献，并为改进洪水预测方法提供依据。为全面评估各种建模范式的潜力，我们评估了六类方法的性能，涵盖多层感知机、卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、图神经网络、Transformer和大型语言模型。实验验证了不同关键特征对洪水预测的影响。我们的分析从时间和空间两个维度展开，揭示了历史数据和空间依赖性的影响。这些方法性能的差异凸显了每种方法在捕捉复合洪水复杂时间和空间依赖性方面的独特能力。

> Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.
