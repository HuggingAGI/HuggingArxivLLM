# 摘要

> 基因集分析（GSA）是通过基因与生物过程的关联来解读疾病基因组数据的基础方法。然而，传统方法往往忽视了临床背景，导致结果冗余、非特异性或无关。解读这些结果需要大量手动努力，降低了可靠性和可重复性。为了解决这一问题，我们推出了cGSA——一种基于AI的新型框架，通过引入上下文感知的通路优先级排序来增强GSA。cGSA整合了基因聚类检测、富集分析和大型语言模型，识别出不仅在统计上显著，而且在生物学上有意义的通路。在19种疾病和10种疾病相关生物机制的102个手动整理基因集中进行基准测试显示，cGSA的性能比基线方法高出30%以上。专家验证证实了其更高的精度和可解释性。黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的两项独立案例研究进一步展示了其发现特定背景见解和支持靶向假设生成的潜力。

> Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However, conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.
