> Research and Analysis of Employers' Opinion on the Necessary Skills that Students in the Field of Web Programming Should Possess

# 摘要

> 在 AI 和聊天机器人的时代，基于大型语言模型（能够生成任何语言的代码、撰写文本和总结信息），雇主对学生的要求已经改变。现代 IT 世界通过软件框架和第三方库及 API 实现了编程的高度自动化。这些工具提供了大部分现成功能，引发一个问题：是教授学生使用工具，还是从零开始学习 Web 应用的基本原理？本文分析了 IT 雇主的调查结果，以确定他们认为 Web 编程毕业生应具备哪些技能，才能快速高效地胜任工作。

> In the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots, based on large language models that can generate programming code in any language, write texts and summarize information, it is obvious that the requirements of employers for graduating students have already changed. The modern IT world offers significant automation of programming through software frameworks and a huge set of third-party libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs). All these tools provide most of the necessary functionality out of the box (already implemented), and quite naturally the question arises as to what is more useful for students - to teach how to use these ready-made tools or the basic principles of working and development of web applications from scratch. This paper analyzes the results of a survey conducted among IT employers, aimed to identify what, in their opinion, are the necessary technical skills that graduating students in the field of Web Programming should possess in order to join the company's work as quickly and effectively as possible.
