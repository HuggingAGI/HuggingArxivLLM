> HSSBench: Benchmarking Humanities and Social Sciences Ability for Multimodal Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在众多领域中展现出巨大潜力。然而，现有评估基准主要关注STEM学科的一般知识和逐步推理，却忽视了人文与社会科学（HSS）的独特需求。HSS任务需要跨学科的横向思维和知识整合，这对MLLMs提出了独特挑战，尤其在将抽象概念与视觉表示结合方面。为此，我们推出了HSSBench，一个专为多语言HSS任务设计的基准测试，涵盖联合国六种官方语言。我们还开发了专为HSS场景设计的数据生成管道，通过多领域专家与自动化代理协作生成并优化样本。HSSBench包含13,000多个精心设计的样本，覆盖六大关键类别。我们在HSSBench上对20多种主流MLLMs进行了测试，结果显示即使是当前最先进的模型也面临重大挑战。我们希望这一基准测试能激发研究者进一步提升MLLMs的跨学科推理能力，特别是其整合和连接跨领域知识的能力。

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.
