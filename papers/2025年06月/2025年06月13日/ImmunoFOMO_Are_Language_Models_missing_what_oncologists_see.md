# 摘要

> 过去十年间，语言模型 (LMs) 的能力突飞猛进，这促使生物医学等多领域研究者纷纷探索 LMs 在日常工作中的应用潜力。领域特定语言模型已在生物医学自然语言处理 (NLP) 中崭露头角。而近期，人们对医学语言模型及其理解能力的兴趣日益增长。本研究对比了不同语言模型在识别乳腺癌免疫治疗标志物方面的医学概念基础，与专家临床医生进行对比。结果显示，预训练语言模型在识别具体（低级）概念方面可能优于大型语言模型。

> Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research, to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications. Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained language models have potential to outperform large language models in identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.
