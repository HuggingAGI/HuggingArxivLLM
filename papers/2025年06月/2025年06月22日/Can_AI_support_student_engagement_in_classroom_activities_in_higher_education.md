> 诱人的职业前景和丰富的创意机会常常吸引学生选择计算机科学专业并继续深造，这导致计算机科学课程的 enrollment 数量激增，班级规模从数百人到上千人不等。然而，大班额教学中常见的挑战是学生与教师以及学习材料之间的互动不足。随着技术的进步和大型语言模型（LLMs）的改进，我们有巨大的机会利用基于LLM的AI模型（如会话式人工智能，CAI）来提升大班额中学生对学习内容的参与度。为了探索CAI在支持学生参与学习内容方面的潜力，我们在一门软件工程课程（大班额）中设计了一项活动，让学生在课堂活动中使用CAI。我们在美国某大学的大班教室中进行了一项单组实验，比较了使用CAI工具与未使用CAI工具的课堂活动中的学生参与度。我们选择ChatGPT作为CAI工具，因其广泛流行且广为人知。研究结果表明，CAI（ChatGPT）在课堂活动中支持学生参与学习内容方面具有潜力，尤其是在大班额中。我们进一步讨论了研究结果的含义。

> Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field. Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the implications of our findings.
