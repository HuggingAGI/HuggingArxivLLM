> CoachGPT: A Scaffolding-based Academic Writing Assistant

# 摘要

> 学术写作能力对学生取得成功至关重要，但缺乏正确指导和练习时，尤其是在第二语言写作中，可能会让人望而生畏。传统上，学生向导师请教或查阅词典，但这些资源并非随处可得。早期的写作助手作为基于规则的系统，专注于检测拼写错误、主谓不一致和基本标点错误；然而，它们不够准确且缺乏语境理解能力。基于机器学习的助手在语言理解方面表现出色，但训练成本高昂。大型语言模型（LLMs）在根据给定提示生成自然语言响应方面表现出色。然而，它们在教育领域存在一个根本性局限：它们生成文章却不进行教学，滥用时会对学习产生负面影响。为解决这一局限，我们开发了CoachGPT，它利用大型语言模型（LLMs）帮助资源有限的个人以及偏好自主学习者进行学术写作。CoachGPT是一个基于AI代理的网络应用程序，(1) 从经验丰富的教育者那里获取指令，(2) 将指令转化为子任务，(3) 利用大型语言模型提供实时反馈和建议。这种独特的支架结构使CoachGPT在现有写作助手中独树一帜。与现有写作助手相比，CoachGPT提供了更具沉浸感的写作体验，带有个性化的反馈和指导。我们的用户研究表明CoachGPT的实用性以及大型语言模型在学术写作中的潜力。

> Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings, subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic writing.
