> AI代理经历了从强化学习（RL）主导到大语言模型（LLMs）驱动的转变，如今正迈向RL与LLM能力的协同融合。这一演进赋予了AI代理越来越强大的能力。然而，面对复杂的现实任务，代理仍需具备有效规划与执行、可靠记忆以及与其他代理顺畅协作的能力。这些能力的实现需要应对复杂的信息、操作和交互。为应对这一挑战，数据结构化通过将复杂无序的数据转化为结构良好的形式，使代理能够更高效地理解和处理。在此背景下，图结构凭借其在组织、管理和利用复杂数据关系方面的天然优势，为结构化数据提供了一种强大的范式，以支持先进AI代理所需的能力。为此，本综述首次系统性地探讨了图结构如何赋能AI代理。具体而言，我们探索了图技术与代理核心功能的融合，突出了值得注意的应用，并指出了未来研究的潜在方向。通过全面调研这一蓬勃发展的交叉领域，我们希望激发下一代AI代理的发展，使其能够借助图结构应对日益复杂的挑战。相关资源已整理并在GitHub链接中持续更新，供社区使用。

> AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process. In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing, and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents. To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.
