> Automated Heuristic Design for Unit Commitment Using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 机组组合（Unit Commitment, UC）是电力系统最优调度中的经典难题。多年的研究与实践表明，合理的机组组合方案能显著提升电力系统的运行效益。近年来，随着机器学习和拉格朗日松弛法等技术的引入， UC 问题的求解方法日益多样化，但在准确性和鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战。本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的功能空间搜索（FunSearch）方法。该方法结合预训练的大型语言模型和评估器，通过程序搜索和演化过程创造性地生成解决方案，同时确保其合理性。仿真实验中，主要采用包含 \(10\) 个机组的案例进行研究。与遗传算法相比，实验结果表明 FunSearch 在采样时间、评估时间和系统总运行成本方面表现更优，展现出作为解决 UC 问题的有效工具的巨大潜力。

> The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving the UC problem.
