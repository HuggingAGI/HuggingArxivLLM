> Sense and Sensibility: What makes a social robot convincing to high-school students?

# 摘要

> 这项针对40名高中生的研究展示了社交教育机器人对学生在8道电路真伪判断题上的决策产生的显著影响。这些问题的理论知识已经在学生的课程中讲授过。机器人在6道题上支持正确答案，在2道题上支持错误答案。结果显示，75%的学生被机器人说服，表现超出了他们的预期能力——当机器人给出正确答案时表现积极，当机器人给出错误答案时则表现消极。使用大型语言模型经验更丰富的学生更容易受到机器人的观点影响，尤其是在机器人在两道最容易的题目上给出错误答案时，这表明对AI的熟悉可能会增加对AI传播的错误信息的易感性。

我们进一步研究了机器人以三种不同自信水平（通过语义、语调和面部表情展示）展示其立场，对学生在特定问题上与机器人答案的一致性以及学生对机器人在这些问题上的说服力感知的影响。结果显示，当机器人被描绘为“自信”时，学生在94.4%的情况下与机器人答案一致；当机器人表现“中立”时，这一比例为82.6%；当机器人表现“不确定”时，比例为71.4%。所有情况下的一致性都较高，凸显了学生普遍容易接受机器人的立场，但“不确定”情况下的学生一致性显著低于“自信”情况。测试后问卷进一步显示，学生认为机器人在“自信”状态下最具说服力。这些发现强调了教育机器人应根据所传达信息的可靠性调整其自信展示的重要性，以促进学生的批判性思维并减少不当影响。

> This study with 40 high-school students demonstrates the high influence of a social educational robot on students' decision-making for a set of eight true-false questions on electric circuits, for which the theory had been covered in the students' courses. The robot argued for the correct answer on six questions and the wrong on two, and 75% of the students were persuaded by the robot to perform beyond their expected capacity, positively when the robot was correct and negatively when it was wrong. Students with more experience of using large language models were even more likely to be influenced by the robot's stance -- in particular for the two easiest questions on which the robot was wrong -- suggesting that familiarity with AI can increase susceptibility to misinformation by AI.
  We further examined how three different levels of portrayed robot certainty, displayed using semantics, prosody and facial signals, affected how the students aligned with the robot's answer on specific questions and how convincing they perceived the robot to be on these questions. The students aligned with the robot's answers in 94.4% of the cases when the robot was portrayed as Certain, 82.6% when it was Neutral and 71.4% when it was Uncertain. The alignment was thus high for all conditions, highlighting students' general susceptibility to accept the robot's stance, but alignment in the Uncertain condition was significantly lower than in the Certain. Post-test questionnaire answers further show that students found the robot most convincing when it was portrayed as Certain. These findings highlight the need for educational robots to adjust their display of certainty based on the reliability of the information they convey, to promote students' critical thinking and reduce undue influence.
