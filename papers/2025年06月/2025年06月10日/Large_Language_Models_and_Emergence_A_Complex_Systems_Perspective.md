> Large Language Models and Emergence: A Complex Systems Perspective

# 摘要

> 涌现是复杂科学中的重要概念，它描述了多体系统如何展现出新颖的高层属性。这些属性可以通过用低维的有效变量和理论替代高维机制来描述，正如“多即是不同”所概括的那样。智能作为一种完善的涌现属性，表现为越来越高效地利用涌现能力解决问题，正如“少即是多”所概括的那样。本文将探讨大型语言模型是否具备涌现能力，并回顾了若干量化涌现的方法，同时探讨LLMs是否具备涌现智能。

> Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper, we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.
