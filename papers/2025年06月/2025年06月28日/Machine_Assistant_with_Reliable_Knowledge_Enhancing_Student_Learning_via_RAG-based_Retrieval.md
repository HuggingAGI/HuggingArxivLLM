> Machine Assistant with Reliable Knowledge: Enhancing Student Learning via RAG-based Retrieval

# 摘要

> 我们推出了 Machine Assistant with Reliable Knowledge (MARK)，一个旨在支持学生学习的检索增强型问答系统。该系统基于检索增强生成（RAG）框架，整合精选知识库以确保事实一致性。为提升检索效果，我们采用了结合密集向量相似性和稀疏关键词检索的混合策略，有效增强对各类查询的鲁棒性。系统内置反馈机制，学生可对回答进行评分，教师可审阅并修改，优化内容。该系统在课堂中成功替代传统办公时间，解决了学生广泛问题。通过整合客户特定知识库，它还展示了在实际应用中处理常规、上下文敏感任务的能力。MARK 系统现已开放，访问地址为 https://app.eduquery.ai。

> We present Machine Assistant with Reliable Knowledge (MARK), a retrieval-augmented question-answering system designed to support student learning through accurate and contextually grounded responses. The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains. MARK is publicly accessible at https://app.eduquery.ai.
