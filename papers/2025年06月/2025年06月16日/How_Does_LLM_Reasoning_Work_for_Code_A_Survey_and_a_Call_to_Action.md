> How Does LLM Reasoning Work for Code? A Survey and a Call to Action

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起在众多自然语言任务中带来了革命性提升，其影响力也延伸至代码领域，助力代码生成、翻译、总结与修复等复杂任务。然而，这些模型在真实世界中的实际应用，特别是在软件工程（SWE）任务如GitHub问题解决上的潜力，近期才开始受到关注。本研究聚焦于支撑这些任务的代码推理技术，并深入探讨推动其性能的核心范式。本文的主要贡献包括：(1) 首个专注于代码任务的代码推理综述，系统梳理总体策略、混合方法及智能体方法；(2) 构建代码推理技术的分类体系；(3) 全面解析常见基准测试的性能表现，同时推出具有高潜力但在SWE领域尚未充分挖掘的新基准；(4) 探索如何通过代码的固有特性来阐明不同推理机制；(5) 指出现有研究的空白及未来探索的潜在方向。

> The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led to dramatic improvements across a wide range of natural language tasks. These advancements have extended into the domain of code, facilitating complex tasks such as code generation, translation, summarization, and repair. However, their utility for real-world deployment in-the-wild has only recently been studied, particularly on software engineering (SWE) tasks such as GitHub issue resolution. In this study, we examine the code reasoning techniques that underlie the ability to perform such tasks, and examine the paradigms used to drive their performance. Our contributions in this paper are: (1) the first dedicated survey on code reasoning for code tasks, highlighting overarching strategies, hybrid and agentic approaches; (2) a taxonomy of various techniques used to drive code reasoning; (3) a comprehensive overview of performance on common benchmarks and a showcase of new, under-explored benchmarks with high potential in SWE; (4) an exploration on how core properties of code can be used to explain different reasoning techniques; and (5) gaps and potentially under-explored areas for future research.
