> Rethinking Test-Time Scaling for Medical AI: Model and Task-Aware Strategies for LLMs and VLMs

# 摘要

> 测试时缩放（Test-time scaling）已成为提升大型语言模型和视觉语言模型推理能力的有前景方法。尽管多种策略已被提出，且在医学领域的应用备受关注，但其对视觉语言模型的有效性及不同场景下的最优策略选择仍有待深入探索。本文全面研究了医学领域的测试时缩放，评估其对大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的影响，考虑了模型规模、固有特性和任务复杂度等因素。此外，我们还评估了这些策略在面对用户驱动因素（如提示中嵌入的误导信息）时的鲁棒性。我们的研究为医学应用中有效使用测试时缩放提供了实用指南，并为策略的进一步优化以满足医学领域对可靠性和可解释性的需求提供了见解。

> Test-time scaling has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models or vision-language models during inference. Although a variety of test-time scaling strategies have been proposed, and interest in their application to the medical domain is growing, many critical aspects remain underexplored, including their effectiveness for vision-language models and the identification of optimal strategies for different settings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling in the medical domain. We evaluate its impact on both large language models and vision-language models, considering factors such as model size, inherent model characteristics, and task complexity. Finally, we assess the robustness of these strategies under user-driven factors, such as misleading information embedded in prompts. Our findings offer practical guidelines for the effective use of test-time scaling in medical applications and provide insights into how these strategies can be further refined to meet the reliability and interpretability demands of the medical domain.
