> Socratic RL: A Novel Framework for Efficient Knowledge Acquisition through Iterative Reflection and Viewpoint Distillation

# 摘要

> 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）的强化学习（RL）方法通常依赖于基于结果的简单奖励信号（例如，最终答案的正确性），这限制了每次交互中学习的深度。本文介绍了苏格拉底式强化学习（Socratic-RL），一种旨在解决这一限制的新型过程导向框架。该框架基于通过反思推理过程中错误与成功的因果原因来实现更深层次理解的原则。苏格拉底-RL采用分离的“教师-学生”架构，其中“教师AI”分析交互历史，提取因果见解，并将其转化为结构化的“观点”。这些观点作为提炼后的指导，由“学生AI”用于提升其后续推理能力。一项关键创新是教师AI的迭代自我改进，使其反思能力通过元学习循环不断进化。为管理知识的积累，蒸馏机制将学习到的观点压缩到学生的参数中。通过关注过程而非仅关注结果，苏格拉底-RL为实现增强的样本效率、更优的可解释性以及自我改进AI系统的可扩展架构提供了一条途径。本文详细阐述了该框架的基础概念、正式机制、协同作用、挑战以及具体的研究路线图。

> Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.
