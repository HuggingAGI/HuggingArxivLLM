# 摘要

> 智能技术的飞速发展催生了大小模型协作框架在工业维护领域的广泛应用，但同时也面临诸多挑战，包括领域适应性不足、实时性能和可靠性欠佳、集成复杂度高，以及知识表示与融合难题。针对这些问题，我们提出了一种面向工业场景的智能维护框架，采用五层架构设计，将领域特定小模型的精准计算能力与大语言模型的认知推理、知识整合和交互功能相结合，以实现工业应用中更精准、智能和高效的维护目标。通过通信设备机房维护和储能电站智能运维两个实际案例，验证了该框架能显著提升维护效率。

> With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, collaborative frameworks integrating large and small models have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing industrial maintenance. However, several challenges persist, including limited domain adaptability, insufficient real-time performance and reliability, high integration complexity, and difficulties in knowledge representation and fusion. To address these issues, an intelligent maintenance framework for industrial scenarios is proposed. This framework adopts a five-layer architecture and integrates the precise computational capabilities of domain-specific small models with the cognitive reasoning, knowledge integration, and interactive functionalities of large language models. The objective is to achieve more accurate, intelligent, and efficient maintenance in industrial applications. Two realistic implementations, involving the maintenance of telecommunication equipment rooms and the intelligent servicing of energy storage power stations, demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances maintenance efficiency.
