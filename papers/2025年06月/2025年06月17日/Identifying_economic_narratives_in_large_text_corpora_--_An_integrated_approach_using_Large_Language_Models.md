> Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 近年来，随着经济叙事研究的兴起，越来越多的文本处理流水线致力于从文本中提取这类叙事。这些流水线通常采用BERT等先进的自然语言处理技术，但在提取经济叙事时，这些模型缺乏更深层次的语义理解能力。我们不依赖复杂的模型流水线，而是通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的新闻文章，评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的优势。我们采用严格的叙事定义，将GPT-4o的输出与专家标注者生成的黄金标准叙事进行比较。研究发现，GPT-4o能够以结构化格式提取有效的经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍未能达到专家水平。鉴于LLMs在经济研究中的新颖性，我们为未来在经济学和社会科学领域利用LLMs实现类似目标的研究提供了指导。

> As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.
