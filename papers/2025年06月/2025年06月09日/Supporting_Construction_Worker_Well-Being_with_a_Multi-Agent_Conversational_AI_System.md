# 摘要

> 建筑行业因高体力和高心理风险而闻名，但心理健康支持却十分有限。尽管人工智能（AI）的发展，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs），带来了有前景的解决方案，但它们在建筑领域的潜力仍未得到充分挖掘。为填补这一空白，我们开发了一个基于AI的多智能体对话系统，整合专业知识，针对性解决行业难题。同时，通过与多个具有独特个性的智能体互动，满足建筑工人的基本心理需求，实现问题解决与社交互动的双重支持，最终促进其整体福祉。我们通过一项包含12名参与者的被试内研究评估了系统的可用性和有效性。结果显示，与单智能体基线相比，我们的系统在可用性、自我决定、社会存在感和信任方面分别提升了18%、40%、60%和60%。这些发现凸显了LLM驱动的AI系统在为建筑工人提供专业支持方面的巨大潜力。

> The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12 participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific support for construction workers.
