# 摘要

> 艺术策展历来是人类专家的主观工作，他们通过广泛的艺术知识挑选作品，将其在公共空间展出，这些空间逐渐演变成美术馆。策展过程没有固定规则，主题可由策展人提出或提供。我们基于机器学习技术开发了四个相关模型，试图从人类策展的展览中学习，以实现类似策展工作。我们专注于纽约大都会博物馆过去25年的展览，受限于数据质量和研究条件。我们的模型在模仿策展人方面表现出色，尽管精确度和连贯性有所差异。特别地，我们得出两个关键发现：首先，展览包含足够信息构建高精度复制过去展览的人工智能模型；其次，通过特征工程和谨慎设计模型架构，适度规模的模型可媲美大型语言模型的蛮力方法。基于样本外实验的小规模尝试，我们相信，随着更多数据的获取，人工智能代理将越来越接近人类策展人的审美和判断能力。

> Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts, who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art curators.
