> A Platform for Investigating Public Health Content with Efficient Concern Classification

# 摘要

> 最近，网上出现了大量表达对公共健康倡议担忧的内容，这阻碍了全球预防措施的采纳。未来公共健康工作必须努力理解这些内容，找出它们可能引发读者的担忧，并有效地回应。为此，我们推出了ConcernScope平台。该平台使用教师-学生框架，将大型语言模型的知识转移到轻量级分类器上，从而快速有效地识别文本中的健康担忧。平台支持上传大量文件、自动抓取特定链接以及直接编辑文本。ConcernScope是基于公共健康担忧的分类法构建的，专为公共健康官员设计。我们展示了该平台的几个应用场景：引导式数据探索，从在线社区数据集中找到常见的担忧实例；通过分析186,000个样本的时间序列，识别担忧的趋势；以及在重大事件前后，发现主题频率的变化趋势。

> A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.
