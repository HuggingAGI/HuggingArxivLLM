> ChatAR: Conversation Support using Large Language Model and Augmented Reality

# 摘要

> 与人流畅对话是项关键社交能力。然而，对话双方的知识差异有时会影响沟通效果。为解决这一问题，本研究提出了一种结合头戴式显示器（HMD）增强现实（AR）技术和大型语言模型（LLMs）的实时对话支持系统。该系统通过在对话中识别关键词，利用LLM生成并重新格式化相关信息，通过HMD向用户呈现，从而帮助对话进行。然而，该系统面临一个问题：用户的眼神移动可能会暴露他们正在阅读显示内容。针对这一问题，本研究提出了一种在对话中考虑适当眼神交流的信息呈现方法。为了验证该系统的有效性，我们进行了两项实验。实验结果表明，该方法不仅降低了对话对方察觉用户在阅读内容的可能性，还使双方发言比例更加均衡，同时提升了对话的趣味性。

> Engaging in smooth conversations with others is a crucial social skill. However, differences in knowledge between conversation participants can sometimes hinder effective communication. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a real-time support system that integrates head-mounted display (HMD)-based augmented reality (AR) technology with large language models (LLMs). This system facilitates conversation by recognizing keywords during dialogue, generating relevant information using the LLM, reformatting it, and presenting it to the user via the HMD. A significant issue with this system is that the user's eye movements may reveal to the conversation partner that they are reading the displayed text. This study also proposes a method for presenting information that takes into account appropriate eye movements during conversation. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The first experiment revealed that the proposed information presentation method reduces the likelihood of the conversation partner noticing that the user is reading the displayed text. The second experiment demonstrated that the proposed method led to a more balanced speech ratio between the user and the conversation partner, as well as a increase in the perceived excitement of the conversation.
