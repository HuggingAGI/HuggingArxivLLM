> JingFang: A Traditional Chinese Medicine Large Language Model of Expert-Level Medical Diagnosis and Syndrome Differentiation-Based Treatment

# 摘要

> 中医在健康保护和疾病治疗中发挥着重要作用，但实际应用需要广泛的专业知识和临床经验。现有中医大语言模型（LLMs）在医疗咨询、诊断及基于证候的治疗方面存在明显局限。本研究推出“经方”（JF）：一种新型中医大语言模型，展现专家级别的诊断与基于证候的治疗能力。我们创新性地提出多智能体动态协作链式思维机制（MDCCTM）用于医疗咨询，赋予JF强大的诊断能力。此外，我们开发了证候智能体和双阶段检索方案（DSRS），显著提升JF基于证候的治疗能力。经方不仅推动了大语言模型的应用，也为中医在健康保护和疾病治疗中的有效实践提供了支持。

> Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a vital role in health protection and disease treatment, but its practical application requires extensive medical knowledge and clinical experience. Existing TCM Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit critical limitations of uncomprehensive medical consultation and diagnoses, and inaccurate syndrome differentiation-based treatment. To address these issues, this study establishes JingFang (JF): a novel TCM Large Language Model that demonstrates the expert-level capability of medical diagnosis and syndrome differentiation-based treatment. We innovate a Multi-agent Dynamic Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MDCCTM) for medical consultation, enabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a Syndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Retrieval Scheme (DSRS) are developed to significantly enhance the capacity of JF for disease treatment based on syndrome differentiation. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs but also promotes the effective practice of TCM in human health protection and disease treatment.
