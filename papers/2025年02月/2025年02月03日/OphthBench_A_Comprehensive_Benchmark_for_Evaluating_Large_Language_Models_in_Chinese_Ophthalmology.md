> OphthBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Chinese Ophthalmology

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗领域展现出巨大潜力，尤其在眼科应用中表现突出。通过整合LLMs，许多眼科任务得到了显著提升。然而，在LLMs广泛应用于临床之前，评估其能力并识别局限性至关重要。为此，我们推出了OphthBench，一个专门用于评估LLMs在中国眼科实践中表现的基准。该基准将典型眼科临床工作流程分为五大场景：教育、分诊、诊断、治疗和预后。每个场景下，我们设计了多种任务，涵盖多样问题类型，最终形成一个包含9个任务和591个问题的综合基准。这一框架全面评估了LLMs的能力，并为其在中国眼科的实际应用提供了深入见解。基于此基准，我们对39个主流LLMs进行了广泛实验和结果分析。评估揭示了当前LLM开发与临床应用之间的差距，为未来发展方向提供了明确指引。通过弥合这一差距，我们旨在释放LLMs的潜力，推动其在眼科领域的进一步发展。

> Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise across various medical applications, with ophthalmology being a notable area of focus. Many ophthalmic tasks have shown substantial improvement through the integration of LLMs. However, before these models can be widely adopted in clinical practice, evaluating their capabilities and identifying their limitations is crucial. To address this research gap and support the real-world application of LLMs, we introduce the OphthBench, a specialized benchmark designed to assess LLM performance within the context of Chinese ophthalmic practices. This benchmark systematically divides a typical ophthalmic clinical workflow into five key scenarios: Education, Triage, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis. For each scenario, we developed multiple tasks featuring diverse question types, resulting in a comprehensive benchmark comprising 9 tasks and 591 questions. This comprehensive framework allows for a thorough assessment of LLMs' capabilities and provides insights into their practical application in Chinese ophthalmology. Using this benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments and analyzed the results from 39 popular LLMs. Our evaluation highlights the current gap between LLM development and its practical utility in clinical settings, providing a clear direction for future advancements. By bridging this gap, we aim to unlock the potential of LLMs and advance their development in ophthalmology.
