# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）正在重塑医疗领域的临床决策和运营模式。DeepSeek作为领先的AI系统，自2025年1月以来已在中国的三级医院广泛应用。最初在上海的主要医疗机构实施后，该系统迅速扩展至全国，提高了诊断准确性，优化了工作流程，改善了患者管理。基于AI的病理学、影像分析和临床决策支持系统在优化医疗流程和减轻医疗专业人员认知负担方面表现出巨大潜力。然而，AI在医疗领域的广泛应用带来了关键的监管和伦理挑战，特别是在AI辅助诊断的责任归属和自动化偏见风险方面。缺乏明确的责任框架凸显了制定确保AI作为辅助工具而非自主决策者发挥作用的政策需求。随着技术的持续进步，AI预计将整合多模态数据源，如基因组学和放射组学，为精准医学和个性化治疗策略铺平道路。医疗领域AI的未来取决于透明监管框架、行业合作和平衡创新与责任的治理框架的发展，以确保公平和有效的AI驱动医疗服务。

> The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is transforming clinical decision-making and hospital operations. DeepSeek has emerged as a leading AI system, widely deployed across China's tertiary hospitals since January 2025. Initially implemented in Shanghai's major medical institutions, it has since expanded nationwide, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and improving patient management. AI-powered pathology, imaging analysis, and clinical decision support systems have demonstrated significant potential in optimizing medical processes and reducing the cognitive burden on healthcare professionals. However, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare raises critical regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly regarding accountability in AI-assisted diagnosis and the risk of automation bias. The absence of a well-defined liability framework underscores the need for policies that ensure AI functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. With continued technological advancements, AI is expected to integrate multimodal data sources, such as genomics and radiomics, paving the way for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies. The future of AI in healthcare depends on the development of transparent regulatory structures, industry collaboration, and adaptive governance frameworks that balance innovation with responsibility, ensuring equitable and effective AI-driven medical services.
