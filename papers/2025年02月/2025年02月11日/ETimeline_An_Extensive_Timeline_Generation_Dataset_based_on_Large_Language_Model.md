# 摘要

> 时间线生成对全面理解事件发展至关重要。它通过按时间顺序组织新闻，帮助识别孤立新闻中可能被忽视的模式和趋势，使跟踪故事发展和理解关键事件间的关系更加容易。如今，时间线在各类商业产品中广泛应用，但学术研究却相对稀缺。此外，现有数据集在实用性和覆盖面方面仍有提升空间。本文提出ETimeline，包含超过$13,000$篇新闻文章，跨越$28$个新闻领域的$600$条双语时间线。我们从$120,000$多篇新闻文章中筛选，并借助大型语言模型（LLM）Pipeline优化性能，最终构建了ETimeline。数据分析凸显了ETimeline的独特价值。此外，我们还开放新闻池数据，支持进一步研究。这项研究推动了时间线生成领域的进展，为包括主题生成和事件关系分析在内的多种任务提供了支持。我们相信，这一数据集将激发创新研究，并在技术服务的实际应用中架起学术界与产业界的桥梁。数据集获取链接：https://zenodo.org/records/11392212。

> Timeline generation is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the development of events over time. Its goal is to organize news chronologically, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be obscured when viewing news in isolation, making it easier to track the development of stories and understand the interrelationships between key events. Timelines are now common in various commercial products, but academic research in this area is notably scarce. Additionally, the current datasets are in need of refinement for enhanced utility and expanded coverage. In this paper, we propose ETimeline, which encompasses over $13,000$ news articles, spanning $600$ bilingual timelines across $28$ news domains. Specifically, we gather a candidate pool of more than $120,000$ news articles and employ the large language model (LLM) Pipeline to improve performance, ultimately yielding the ETimeline. The data analysis underscores the appeal of ETimeline. Additionally, we also provide the news pool data for further research and analysis. This work contributes to the advancement of timeline generation research and supports a wide range of tasks, including topic generation and event relationships. We believe that this dataset will serve as a catalyst for innovative research and bridge the gap between academia and industry in understanding the practical application of technology services.
