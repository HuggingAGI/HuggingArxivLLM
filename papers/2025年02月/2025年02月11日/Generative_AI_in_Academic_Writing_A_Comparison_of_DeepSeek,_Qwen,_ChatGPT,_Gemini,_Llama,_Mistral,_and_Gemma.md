> Generative AI in Academic Writing: A Comparison of DeepSeek, Qwen, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and Gemma

# 摘要

> 2025年初，DeepSeek和Qwen大型语言模型凭借其低成本和开放获取的解决方案迅速走红。2024年12月，一家位于中国浙江省杭州市的公司宣布推出新版大型语言模型DeepSeek v3。随后，阿里巴巴于2025年1月29日发布了其AI模型Qwen 2.5 Max。这些免费且开源的工具在全球范围内引发了广泛关注。DeepSeek和Qwen不仅为全球研究人员和个人提供了强大的学术写作和内容创作工具，更有可能在未来成为学术界的重要助力。因此，评估这些新大型语言模型生成高质量学术内容的能力至关重要。

本研究旨在通过对比分析，评估Qwen 2.5 Max和DeepSeek v3的学术写作性能。我们选取了40篇关于数字孪生和医疗保健领域的文章作为研究对象，采用生成式AI工具根据问题和改写摘要生成文本内容。随后，通过抄袭检测工具、AI检测工具、字数统计、语义相似性分析和可读性评估等多维度方法对生成文本进行了全面评估。

研究发现，改写摘要文本的抄袭率普遍较高，而对问题生成的回答抄袭率相对较低，但两者均超出可接受范围。AI检测工具显示，所有生成文本均被高度准确识别为AI生成内容。在字数统计方面，所有聊天机器人均能生成令人满意的文本量。语义相似性测试表明，生成文本与原文本具有高度的语义重叠。然而，可读性评估结果显示，生成文本的可读性有待提升。

> Deepseek and Qwen LLMs became popular at the beginning of 2025 with their low-cost and open-access LLM solutions. A company based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, announced its new LLM, DeepSeek v3, in December 2024. Then, Alibaba released its AI model, Qwen 2.5 Max, on January 29, 2025. These tools, which are free and open-source have made a significant impact on the world. Deepseek and Qwen also have the potential to be used by many researchers and individuals around the world in academic writing and content creation. Therefore, it is important to determine the capacity of these new LLMs to generate high-quality academic content. This study aims to evaluate the academic writing performance of both Qwen 2.5 Max and DeepSeek v3 by comparing these models with popular systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and Gemma. In this research, 40 articles on the topics of Digital Twin and Healthcare were used. The method of this study involves using generative AI tools to generate texts based on posed questions and paraphrased abstracts of these 40 articles. Then, the generated texts were evaluated through the plagiarism tool, AI detection tools, word count comparisons, semantic similarity tools and readability assessments. It was observed that plagiarism test result rates were generally higher for the paraphrased abstract texts and lower for the answers generated to the questions, but both were above acceptable levels. In the evaluations made with the AI detection tool, it was determined with high accuracy that all the generated texts were detected as AI-generated. In terms of the generated word count comparison, it was evaluated that all chatbots generated satisfactory amount of content. Semantic similarity tests show that the generated texts have high semantic overlap with the original texts. The readability tests indicated that the generated texts were not sufficiently readable.
