# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的零样本学习能力显著提升。鉴于LLMs对输入的高敏感性，研究逐渐转向通过简单直接的提示工程优化模型性能，而非复杂的领域适配。研究表明，LLMs具备情感智能，积极与消极情绪均能提升任务表现。然而，以往研究多聚焦单一刺激类型，忽视了不同刺激效果的比较、任务难度变化的影响，以及机制的探讨。本文受社会认知理论启发，提出语言效能刺激（VES），包含鼓励、挑逗和批评三种语言提示，涵盖帮助性、专业性等六个维度。我们进一步将任务难度分类，全面探究不同VES如何影响语言模型在不同难度下的自我效能和任务表现。实验显示，三种VES均能提升LLMs在大部分任务上的性能，且不同模型最有效的VES各不相同。实验结果与心理学理论一致，为未来研究提供了新思路。


> Significant improvements have been observed in the zero-shot capabilities of the Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to their high sensitivity to input, research has increasingly focused on enhancing LLMs' performance via direct and simple prompt engineering rather than intricate domain adaptation. Studies suggest that LLMs exhibit emotional intelligence, and both positive and negative emotions can potentially enhance task performances. However, prior interaction prompts have predominantly concentrated on a single stimulus type, neglecting to compare different stimulus effects, examine the influence of varying task difficulties, or explore underlying mechanisms. This paper, inspired by the positive correlation between self-efficacy and task performance within the social cognitive theory, introduces Verbal Efficacy Stimulations (VES). Our VES comprises three types of verbal prompts: encouraging, provocative, and critical, addressing six aspects such as helpfulness and competence. And we further categorize task difficulty, aiming to extensively investigate how distinct VES influence the self-efficacy and task achievements of language models at varied levels of difficulty. The experimental results show that the three types of VES improve the performance of LLMs on most tasks, and the most effective VES varies for different models. In extensive experiments, we have obtained some findings consistent with psychological theories, providing novel insights for future research.
