> Latent Convergence Modulation in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Iterative Contextual Realignment

# 摘要

> 自回归生成模型中，令牌预测稳定性是一个长期挑战。早期推理中的微小变化常导致长序列语义显著偏离。为此，我们引入了一种结构化调制机制，通过调控隐藏状态的转换，确保潜在表示轨迹与上下文依赖一致，同时保持生成的灵活性。该机制设计为在 transformer 架构中运行，动态约束表示演化，无需额外记忆或大幅修改架构。实证结果显示，这种潜在调整显著降低了困惑度波动、熵方差和词汇不稳定性，提升长文本生成的一致性。梯度传播分析表明，调制过程优化路径更平滑，减少了权重更新的异常波动。计算效率评估显示，该机制集成仅增加微小开销，且与现有优化框架兼容。此外，结构化调制约束还防止了句法重复，保持句子长度分布平衡。与基线模型的对比证实，受控潜在状态演化在提升代词解析、逻辑一致性和上下文对齐方面具有显著作用。


> Token prediction stability remains a challenge in autoregressive generative models, where minor variations in early inference steps often lead to significant semantic drift over extended sequences. A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.
