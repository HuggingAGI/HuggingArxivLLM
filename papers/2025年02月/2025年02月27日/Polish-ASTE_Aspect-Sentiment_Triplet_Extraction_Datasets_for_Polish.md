> Polish-ASTE: Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction Datasets for Polish

# 摘要

> 方面情感三元组抽取（ASTE）是情感分析领域最具挑战性和复杂性的任务之一。它专注于构建包含方面、情感极性及其理由意见短语的三元组。尽管该任务备受关注且有多种机器学习方法被提出，但可用于ASTE的数据集却非常有限。特别地，斯拉夫语言中尚无相关数据集。本文中，我们为波兰语推出了两个新的ASTE数据集，涵盖了客户对酒店和产品的看法。我们结合两种ASTE技术与针对波兰语的大型语言模型进行实验，以评估其性能和数据集难度。新数据集在宽松许可下开放，并采用与英文数据集相同的格式，便于未来研究使用。

> Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is one of the most challenging and complex tasks in sentiment analysis. It concerns the construction of triplets that contain an aspect, its associated sentiment polarity, and an opinion phrase that serves as a rationale for the assigned polarity. Despite the growing popularity of the task and the many machine learning methods being proposed to address it, the number of datasets for ASTE is very limited. In particular, no dataset is available for any of the Slavic languages. In this paper, we present two new datasets for ASTE containing customer opinions about hotels and purchased products expressed in Polish. We also perform experiments with two ASTE techniques combined with two large language models for Polish to investigate their performance and the difficulty of the assembled datasets. The new datasets are available under a permissive licence and have the same file format as the English datasets, facilitating their use in future research.
