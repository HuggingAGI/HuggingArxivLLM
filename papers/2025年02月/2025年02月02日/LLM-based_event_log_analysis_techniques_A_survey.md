# 摘要

> 事件日志分析是安全专业人员的重要任务，记录计算设备活动的关键信息。由于事件数量庞大，分析耗时且易出错。为此，研究人员开发了自动化技术来优化这一过程。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）展现了卓越能力，能够以高标准和高效完成多种任务，超越人类表现。因此，研究人员正积极探索将LLMs应用于事件日志分析，包括微调、检索增强生成（RAG）和上下文学习等方法，这些方法显著影响性能。尽管已有显著进展，但仍需深入理解知识体系，识别共性，并解决关键挑战。本文旨在综述基于LLM的事件日志分析技术，为读者提供领域概览，指出研究空白，并展望未来探索方向。

> Event log analysis is an important task that security professionals undertake. Event logs record key information on activities that occur on computing devices, and due to the substantial number of events generated, they consume a large amount of time and resources to analyse. This demanding and repetitive task is also prone to errors. To address these concerns, researchers have developed automated techniques to improve the event log analysis process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to successfully perform a wide range of tasks that individuals would usually partake in, to high standards, and at a pace and degree of complexity that outperform humans. Due to this, researchers are rapidly investigating the use of LLMs for event log analysis. This includes fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and in-context learning, which affect performance. These works demonstrate good progress, yet there is a need to understand the developing body of knowledge, identify commonalities between works, and identify key challenges and potential solutions to further developments in this domain. This paper aims to survey LLM-based event log analysis techniques, providing readers with an in-depth overview of the domain, gaps identified in previous research, and concluding with potential avenues to explore in future.
