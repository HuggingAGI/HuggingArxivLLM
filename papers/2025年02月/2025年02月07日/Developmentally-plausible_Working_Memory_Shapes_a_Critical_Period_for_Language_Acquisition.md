> Developmentally-plausible Working Memory Shapes a Critical Period for Language Acquisition

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型虽然展现通用语言能力，但其语言习得效率与人类存在显著差异。本研究提出一种方法，旨在将人类语言习得效率特别高的关键期阶段，工作记忆的发展特征整合到语言模型中。该方法引入了一种机制，最初在训练初期对工作记忆进行限制，随着学习的推进，以指数级方式逐步放松这一限制。针对句法的评估显示，该方法超越了无记忆约束或静态记忆约束的传统模型。这些发现不仅为设计数据高效的语言模型提供了新方向，也为支持人类语言习得中关键期假说的内在机制提供了间接证据。

> Large language models exhibit general linguistic abilities but significantly differ from humans in their efficiency of language acquisition. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional models without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the underlying mechanisms of the critical period hypothesis in human language acquisition.
