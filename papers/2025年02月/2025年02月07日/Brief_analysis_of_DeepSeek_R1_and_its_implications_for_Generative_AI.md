# 摘要

> 2025年1月底，深度求索（DeepSeek）发布了最新的推理模型（DeepSeek R1），该模型以极低的研发成本，突破了美国GPU出口禁令的限制，依然保持了与OpenAI模型相媲美的竞争力。本文将深入探讨这一模型及其对生成式AI领域的重要意义。我们还简要分析了近期中国发布的其他相关模型，发现它们在技术路径上存在诸多共性，其中创新性的专家混合（MoE）架构、强化学习（RL）方法以及精妙的工程实践，似乎是这些模型实现突破的关键所在。本文在紧凑的时间内完成了撰写，力求全面覆盖相关主题，为希望深入了解该模型技术细节及其在AI生态中独特地位的读者提供基础参考。文中还提出了若干值得进一步探索的研究方向。

> In late January 2025, DeepSeek released their new reasoning model (DeepSeek R1); which was developed at a fraction of the cost yet remains competitive with OpenAI's models, despite the US's GPU export ban. This report discusses the model, and what its release means for the field of Generative AI more widely. We briefly discuss other models released from China in recent weeks, their similarities; innovative use of Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and clever engineering appear to be key factors in the capabilities of these models. This think piece has been written to a tight timescale, providing broad coverage of the topic, and serves as introductory material for those looking to understand the model's technical advancements, as well as its place in the ecosystem. Several further areas of research are identified.
