> The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion

# 摘要

> 人工智能的迅猛发展推动了人工代理在社交场景中的广泛应用，从教育到社交媒体，再到金融市场等众多领域。随着人与人工代理互动频率的激增，迫切需要理解人机交互对社会中新思想、新产品及新行为传播的影响。在两个截然不同的实证背景下，我们发现人工代理显著加速并扩大了社会传染的范围。为此，我们通过使用基于大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的人工代理，复制了之前针对人类受试者进行的选择实验。我们利用实验结果测量人工代理的采用阈值及其对社会传染传播的影响。研究发现，人工代理的采用阈值通常低于人类，从而导致基于网络的社会传染范围更广。我们的研究结果表明，人工代理在现实世界网络中的日益普及可能会加速行为转变，甚至可能以意想不到的方式发生。

> Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.
