> Merging Clinical Knowledge into Large Language Models for Medical Research and Applications: A Survey

# 摘要

> 临床知识是通过研究疾病成因、预后、诊断及治疗所积累的知识体系。它不仅能提升治疗效果，还能促进身体健康。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的问世，医学人工智能（医疗AI）迎来了新的发展阶段，学术界和工业界由此诞生了DoctorGPT和Pangu-Drug等杰出成果。然而，该领域尚缺乏一个全面涵盖学术界和工业界构建医疗AI系统的综述和比较。因此，本综述聚焦于医疗AI系统的构建范式，包括临床数据库、数据集的运用、训练流水线、医学知识图谱的整合、系统应用以及评估体系。我们希望通过本综述，相关实践研究人员能够深入了解学术模型在医疗保健各领域的当前表现，以及在实现这些科学成果时可能面临的挑战和未来发展方向。

> Clinical knowledge is the collection of information learned from studies on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This type of knowledge can improve curing performances, and promote physical health. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), medical artificial intelligence (medical AI), which aims to apply academic medical AI systems to real-world medical scenarios, has entered a new age of development, resulting in excellent works such as DoctorGPT and Pangu-Drug from academic and industrial researches. However, the field lacks a comprehensive compendium and comparison of building medical AI systems from academia and industry. Therefore, this survey focuses on the building paradigms of medical AI systems including the use of clinical databases, datasets, training pipelines, integrating medical knowledge graphs, system applications, and evaluation systems. We hope that this survey can help relevant practical researchers understand the current performance of academic models in various fields of healthcare, as well as the potential problems and future directions for implementing these scientific achievements.
