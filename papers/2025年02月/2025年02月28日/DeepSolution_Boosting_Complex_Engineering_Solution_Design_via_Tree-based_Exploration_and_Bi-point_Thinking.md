# 摘要

> 设计复杂工程解决方案在人类生产活动中至关重要，但现有研究在检索增强生成（RAG）领域对这一任务的关注仍显不足。为填补这一空白，我们推出了SolutionBench基准测试，用于评估系统在面对多约束工程问题时生成完整可行解决方案的能力。我们还提出了创新系统SolutionRAG，通过树状探索和双点思维机制生成可靠解决方案。实验结果表明，SolutionRAG在SolutionBench上达到了最先进水平，展示了其在提升复杂工程设计自动化和可靠性方面的潜力。

> Designing solutions for complex engineering challenges is crucial in human production activities. However, previous research in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) field has not sufficiently addressed tasks related to the design of complex engineering solutions. To fill this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, SolutionBench, to evaluate a system's ability to generate complete and feasible solutions for engineering problems with multiple complex constraints. To further advance the design of complex engineering solutions, we propose a novel system, SolutionRAG, that leverages the tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking mechanism to generate reliable solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SolutionRAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the SolutionBench, highlighting its potential to enhance the automation and reliability of complex engineering solution design in real-world applications.
