> EdgeAIGuard: Agentic LLMs for Minor Protection in Digital Spaces

# 摘要

> 社交媒体已经成为未成年人日常生活不可或缺的一部分，广泛用于交友、探索共同兴趣和参与教育活动。然而，屏幕时间的增加也带来了更多挑战，包括网络欺凌、网络诱骗和恶意行为者的剥削。传统的内容审核技术在应对不断变化的剥削手段时显得力不从心。为了应对这些日益严峻的挑战，我们提出了EdgeAIGuard内容审核方法，旨在保护未成年人免受网络诱骗和各种形式的数字剥削。该方法采用多智能体架构，战略性地部署在网络边缘，以实现低延迟的快速检测，防止针对未成年人的有害内容。实验结果表明，该方法比现有方法显著更有效。

> Social media has become integral to minors' daily lives and is used for various purposes, such as making friends, exploring shared interests, and engaging in educational activities. However, the increase in screen time has also led to heightened challenges, including cyberbullying, online grooming, and exploitations posed by malicious actors. Traditional content moderation techniques have proven ineffective against exploiters' evolving tactics. To address these growing challenges, we propose the EdgeAIGuard content moderation approach that is designed to protect minors from online grooming and various forms of digital exploitation. The proposed method comprises a multi-agent architecture deployed strategically at the network edge to enable rapid detection with low latency and prevent harmful content targeting minors. The experimental results show the proposed method is significantly more effective than the existing approaches.
