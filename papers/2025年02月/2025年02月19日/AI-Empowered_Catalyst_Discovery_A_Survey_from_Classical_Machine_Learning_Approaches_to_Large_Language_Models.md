# 摘要

> 催化剂在加速化学反应和提高选择性方面发挥着关键作用，这对实现能源、材料和活性化合物的可持续生产至关重要。催化剂的发现是计算化学中的基础且具挑战性的任务，近年来因先进人工智能（AI）技术的出色表现而备受关注。大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展显著推动了均相和多相催化剂发现的进程，尽管这两种催化剂在材料相态、温度、动力学等方面存在显著差异。然而，目前尚无全面综述探讨这两个领域的发展和最新进展，尤其是在应用LLM技术方面。为填补这一空白，本文提供了一份全面而系统的AI增强型催化剂发现综述，采用统一且通用的分类方法涵盖均相和多相催化剂。我们探讨了AI增强型催化剂发现的进展，突出其优缺点，并讨论了该领域面临的挑战。此外，我们从计算机科学角度提出了未来研究的潜在方向。我们的目标是帮助计算化学、计算机科学及相关领域的研究人员轻松追踪最新进展，为这一领域提供清晰的概述和路线图。我们还整理并开放了相关资源，包括文章列表和数据集，在https://github.com/LuckyGirl-XU/Awesome-Artificial-Intelligence-Empowered-Catalyst-Discovery上供大家访问。


> Catalysts are essential for accelerating chemical reactions and enhancing selectivity, which is crucial for the sustainable production of energy, materials, and bioactive compounds. Catalyst discovery is fundamental yet challenging in computational chemistry and has garnered significant attention due to the promising performance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) notably accelerates progress in the discovery of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, where their chemical reactions differ significantly in material phases, temperature, dynamics, etc. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the progress and latest developments in both areas, particularly with the application of LLM techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic survey of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, employing a unified and general categorization for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. We examine the progress of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, highlighting their individual advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the challenges faced in this field. Furthermore, we suggest potential directions for future research from the perspective of computer science. Our goal is to assist researchers in computational chemistry, computer science, and related fields in easily tracking the latest advancements, providing a clear overview and roadmap of this area. We also organize and make accessible relevant resources, including article lists and datasets, in an open repository at https://github.com/LuckyGirl-XU/Awesome-Artificial-Intelligence-Empowered-Catalyst-Discovery.
