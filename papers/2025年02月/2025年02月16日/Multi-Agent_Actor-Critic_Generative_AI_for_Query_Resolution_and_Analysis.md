# 摘要

> 本文介绍的MASQRAD（多智能体战略查询解析与诊断工具）是一个基于演员-评论家模型的变革性框架，通过多个生成式AI代理实现查询解析。MASQRAD擅长将模糊或不准确的用户查询转化为精准且可执行的请求，并针对这些具体查询生成相关的可视化、响应、分析和解读。它解决了现有方案在快速精准数据解读领域的常见缺陷，如无法有效运用AI生成可执行见解，以及难以应对用户查询中的模糊性。MASQRAD作为一个复杂的多智能体系统运行，却对用户伪装成单一的AI实体，从而降低了错误率并提升了数据交互效果。该框架主要由三种AI代理构成：演员生成式AI负责在运营约束范围内生成数据可视化的Python脚本，评论家生成式AI通过多智能体辩论优化这些脚本，而专家分析生成式AI则将结果置于上下文中以辅助决策。在自然语言可视化相关任务中，MASQRAD的准确率达到87%，它不仅为自动化数据解读设立了新标杆，更展示了一项具有革命性潜力的进步，有望彻底改变AI驱动的应用程序。

> In this paper, we introduce MASQRAD (Multi-Agent Strategic Query Resolution and Diagnostic tool), a transformative framework for query resolution based on the actor-critic model, which utilizes multiple generative AI agents. MASQRAD is excellent at translating imprecise or ambiguous user inquiries into precise and actionable requests. This framework generates pertinent visualizations and responses to these focused queries, as well as thorough analyses and insightful interpretations for users. MASQRAD addresses the common shortcomings of existing solutions in domains that demand fast and precise data interpretation, such as their incapacity to successfully apply AI for generating actionable insights and their challenges with the inherent ambiguity of user queries. MASQRAD functions as a sophisticated multi-agent system but "masquerades" to users as a single AI entity, which lowers errors and enhances data interaction. This approach makes use of three primary AI agents: Actor Generative AI, Critic Generative AI, and Expert Analysis Generative AI. Each is crucial for creating, enhancing, and evaluating data interactions. The Actor AI generates Python scripts to generate data visualizations from large datasets within operational constraints, and the Critic AI rigorously refines these scripts through multi-agent debate. Finally, the Expert Analysis AI contextualizes the outcomes to aid in decision-making. With an accuracy rate of 87\% when handling tasks related to natural language visualization, MASQRAD establishes new benchmarks for automated data interpretation and showcases a noteworthy advancement that has the potential to revolutionize AI-driven applications.
