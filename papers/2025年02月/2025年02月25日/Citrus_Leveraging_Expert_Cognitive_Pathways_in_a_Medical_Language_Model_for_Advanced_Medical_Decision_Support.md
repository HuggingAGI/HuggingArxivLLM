> Citrus: Leveraging Expert Cognitive Pathways in a Medical Language Model for Advanced Medical Decision Support

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs），特别是具备推理能力的模型，近年来突飞猛进，在众多应用领域展现出巨大潜力。然而，在医疗领域的应用，尤其是疾病推理任务中，这些模型的部署因获取专家级认知数据的挑战而受到限制。本文介绍Citrus，一种通过模拟医学专家认知过程弥合临床专业性和AI推理之间鸿沟的医疗语言模型。该模型基于大量模拟专家级疾病推理数据进行训练，这些数据采用一种新颖的方法合成，能够准确捕捉临床医生的决策路径。这种方法使Citrus能够更好地模拟诊断和治疗过程中涉及的复杂推理流程。为进一步解决公开可用医疗推理数据集的缺失问题，我们发布了最后一阶段的训练数据，包括一个定制的医疗诊断对话数据集。这一开源贡献旨在支持该领域的进一步研究与开发。通过MedQA等权威基准测试的评估，涵盖医疗推理和语言理解任务，结果表明Citrus相较于同规模的其他模型实现了更优性能。这些结果凸显了Citrus在显著提升医疗决策支持系统方面的潜力，为临床决策提供了更精准高效的工具。

> Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities, have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential across a wide range of applications. However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions.To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.
