> Intersubjective Model of AI-mediated Communication: Augmenting Human-Human Text Chat through LLM-based Adaptive Agent Pair

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及正在重塑基于文本的在线交流方式，这一变革被称为AI中介沟通。然而，现有研究大多受限于传统沟通模型，信息直接在人与人之间创建和传输，而LLMs其实能在信息转换中发挥更积极的作用。在本研究中，我们提出了AI中介沟通的intersubjective模型，这是一种基于LLM的自适应代理，能够增强人与人之间的沟通。与传统模型侧重信息准确传输不同，intersubjective模型允许以自适应和可定制的方式设计沟通，通过实时动态塑造信息，促进人类参与者之间的共同理解，从而创造替代性互动。本文基于这一模型开发了一个原型文本聊天系统，展示了该模型的潜力及其设计空间。

> The growing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping online text-based communication; a transformation that is extensively studied as AI-mediated communication. However, much of the existing research remains bound by traditional communication models, where messages are created and transmitted directly between humans despite LLMs being able to play a more active role in transforming messages. In this work, we propose the Intersubjective Model of AI-mediated Communication, an alternative communication model that leverages LLM-based adaptive agents to augment human-human communication. Unlike traditional communication models that focus on the accurate transmission of information, the Intersubjective Model allows for communication to be designed in an adaptive and customizable way to create alternative interactions by dynamically shaping messages in real time and facilitating shared understanding between the human participants. In this paper, we have developed a prototype text chat system based on the Intersubjective Model to describe the potential of this model, as well as the design space it affords.
