# 摘要

> 语言障碍人士常因语言处理和理解能力有限而面临沟通难题，这影响了他们与主要依赖自动语音识别（ASR）的语音辅助系统的互动。尽管ASR在处理不流畅问题上有所突破，但对整合非语言交流方式（如手势）的关注却寥寥无几，而这些方式对语言障碍人士来说是重要的沟通补充。我们提出了一种基于零样本学习的多模态大型语言模型的手势感知ASR系统，专为有语音障碍的人群设计。实验结果和分析表明，纳入手势信息能显著提升语义理解能力，助力开发满足语言障碍人士独特需求的有效沟通技术。

> Individuals with language disorders often face significant communication challenges due to their limited language processing and comprehension abilities, which also affect their interactions with voice-assisted systems that mostly rely on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite advancements in ASR that address disfluencies, there has been little attention on integrating non-verbal communication methods, such as gestures, which individuals with language disorders substantially rely on to supplement their communication. Recognizing the need to interpret the latent meanings of visual information not captured by speech alone, we propose a gesture-aware ASR system utilizing a multimodal large language model with zero-shot learning for individuals with speech impairments. Our experiment results and analyses show that including gesture information significantly enhances semantic understanding. This study can help develop effective communication technologies, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of individuals with language impairments.
