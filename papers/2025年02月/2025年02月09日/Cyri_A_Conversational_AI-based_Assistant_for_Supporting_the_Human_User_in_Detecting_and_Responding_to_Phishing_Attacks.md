> Cyri: A Conversational AI-based Assistant for Supporting the Human User in Detecting and Responding to Phishing Attacks

# 摘要

> 我们很高兴推出Cyri——一款专为检测和分析钓鱼邮件而设计的AI会话助手。Cyri的独特之处在于它巧妙地结合了现有文献中的特征与自身创新的特征提取方法，细致检查邮件中常见的钓鱼语义特征，如紧急性和不良后果。Cyri无缝集成到各类邮件客户端，通过本地处理保障数据隐私，避免将敏感信息上传至网络，从而降低安全风险。其精心设计的用户界面通过动态视觉提示和情境化解释，让用户在使用过程中始终保持警觉和知情。用户不仅可以与Cyri对话，还可以通过视觉探索深入理解邮件中的潜在威胁，无论专家还是普通用户都能从中受益。此外，Cyri支持随时查看对话记录，解答关于邮件内容的额外问题，并根据需求进行检测。为了验证Cyri的效果，我们构建了一个包含420封钓鱼邮件和420封合法邮件的大型数据集。实验结果表明，Cyri在识别关键钓鱼语义特征方面表现出色。一项由10名专家和非专家参与的用户研究进一步证实，Cyri不仅显著提升了用户识别钓鱼邮件的能力，还加深了他们对钓鱼战术的理解。

> This work introduces Cyri, an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to support a human user in detecting and analyzing phishing emails by leveraging Large Language Models. Cyri has been designed to scrutinize emails for semantic features used in phishing attacks, such as urgency, and undesirable consequences, using an approach that unifies features already established in the literature with others by Cyri features extraction methodology. Cyri can be directly plugged into a client mail or webmail, ensuring seamless integration with the user's email workflow while maintaining data privacy through local processing. By performing analyses on the user's machine, Cyri eliminates the need to transmit sensitive email data over the internet, reducing associated security risks. The Cyri user interface has been designed to reduce habituation effects and enhance user engagement. It employs dynamic visual cues and context-specific explanations to keep users alert and informed while using emails. Additionally, it allows users to explore identified malicious semantic features both through conversation with the agent and visual exploration, obtaining the advantages of both modalities for expert or non-expert users. It also allows users to keep track of the conversation, supports the user in solving additional questions on both computed features or new parts of the mail, and applies its detection on demand. To evaluate Cyri, we crafted a comprehensive dataset of 420 phishing emails and 420 legitimate emails. Results demonstrate high effectiveness in identifying critical phishing semantic features fundamental to phishing detection. A user study involving 10 participants, both experts and non-experts, evaluated Cyri's effectiveness and usability. Results indicated that Cyri significantly aided users in identifying phishing emails and enhanced their understanding of phishing tactics.
