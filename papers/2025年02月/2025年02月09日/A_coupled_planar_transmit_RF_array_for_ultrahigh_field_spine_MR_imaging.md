> A coupled planar transmit RF array for ultrahigh field spine MR imaging

# 摘要

> 超高场磁共振成像（MRI），如7特斯拉设备，显著提升了诊断能力，但也带来了独特挑战，尤其是在大型样本成像时，需要先进的射频（RF）线圈设计以实现最佳信噪比和发射效率。我们提出了一种新型技术——耦合平面阵列，专为高频、大尺寸RF线圈设计，旨在提升超高场脊柱成像应用中的RF磁场（B1）效率和发射性能。该阵列由多个电磁耦合的谐振器组成，作为一个多模式谐振器运行。其最高频率模式的场分布适用于脊柱成像应用。基于数值建模和计算，我们成功构建了耦合平面阵列的原型，并通过全面的数值模拟、严格的射频测量、实证测试以及与相同尺寸和几何的传统表面线圈的对比，评估了其性能。研究结果表明，与传统表面线圈相比，所提出的耦合平面阵列在B1效率（包括发射场B1+和接收场B1-）、比吸收率（SAR）以及高频运行能力方面均表现出更优越的性能。这项研究为超高磁场下脊柱磁共振成像的高频、大尺寸RF线圈设计提供了一种有前景且高效的解决方案。


> Ultrahigh-field MRI, such as those operating at 7 Tesla, enhances diagnostic capabilities but also presents unique challenges, including the need for advanced RF coil designs to achieve an optimal signal-to-noise ratio and transmit efficiency, particularly when imaging large samples. In this work, we introduce the coupled planar array, a novel technique for high-frequency, large-size RF coil design with enhanced the RF magnetic field (B1) efficiency and transmit performance for ultrahigh-field spine imaging applications. This array comprises multiple resonators that are electromagnetically coupled to function as a single multimodal resonator. The field distribution of its highest frequency mode is suitable for spine imaging applications. Based on the numerical modeling and calculation, a prototype of the coupled planar array was constructed and its performance was evaluated through comprehensive numerical simulations, rigorous RF measurements, empirical tests, and a comparison against a conventional surface coil with the same size and geometry. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed coupled planar array exhibits superior performance compared to conventional surface coils in terms of B1 efficiency for both transmit (B1+) and receive (B1-) fields, specific absorption rate (SAR), and the ability to operate at high frequencies. This study suggests a promising and efficient approach to the design of high-frequency, large-size RF coils for spine MR imaging at ultrahigh magnetic fields.
