> Towards Trustworthy Retrieval Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey

# 摘要

> 检索增强生成（RAG）是一种应对人工智能生成内容（AIGC）挑战的高级技术。它通过整合上下文检索，提供可靠且最新的外部知识，减少幻觉现象，并确保跨任务的相关性。然而，尽管RAG成功且有潜力，但最近研究发现它也带来了新风险，包括鲁棒性问题、隐私担忧、对抗攻击和问责问题。解决这些风险对RAG系统的未来发展至关重要，因为它们直接影响可信度。尽管已有多种方法提升RAG可信度，但该领域仍缺乏统一视角和研究框架。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白，提供一份全面路线图，助力可信RAG系统的开发。我们的讨论围绕五个关键视角展开：可靠性、隐私、安全、公平性、可解释性和问责性。针对每个视角，我们提供了通用框架和分类法，为理解挑战、评估解决方案和识别未来研究方向提供了结构化方法。为了推动更广泛应用和创新，我们还强调了可信RAG系统影响重大的下游应用。

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique designed to address the challenges of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). By integrating context retrieval into content generation, RAG provides reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, reduces hallucinations, and ensures relevant context across a wide range of tasks. However, despite RAG's success and potential, recent studies have shown that the RAG paradigm also introduces new risks, including robustness issues, privacy concerns, adversarial attacks, and accountability issues. Addressing these risks is critical for future applications of RAG systems, as they directly impact their trustworthiness. Although various methods have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of RAG methods, there is a lack of a unified perspective and framework for research in this topic. Thus, in this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing a comprehensive roadmap for developing trustworthy RAG systems. We place our discussion around five key perspectives: reliability, privacy, safety, fairness, explainability, and accountability. For each perspective, we present a general framework and taxonomy, offering a structured approach to understanding the current challenges, evaluating existing solutions, and identifying promising future research directions. To encourage broader adoption and innovation, we also highlight the downstream applications where trustworthy RAG systems have a significant impact.
