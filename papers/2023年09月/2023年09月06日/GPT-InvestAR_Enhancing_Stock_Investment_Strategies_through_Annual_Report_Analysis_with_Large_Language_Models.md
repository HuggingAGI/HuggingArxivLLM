> GPT-InvestAR: Enhancing Stock Investment Strategies through Annual Report Analysis with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 摘要：上市公司的年度报告蕴含着有关其财务状况的关键信息，有助于评估对公司股价的潜在影响。这些报告内容全面，往往多达甚至超过 100 页。哪怕是分析单个公司的报告都颇为繁琐，更别提所有现存的公司了。多年来，金融专家已能相对迅速地从这些文件中提取有价值的信息，然而这需要多年的实践和经验。本文旨在借助大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力简化评估所有公司年度报告的流程。LLM 生成的见解被整理在一个量化风格的数据集中，并结合历史股票价格数据进行增强。随后以 LLM 的输出作为特征训练机器学习模型。前向测试结果表明，相对于标准普尔 500 回报率表现出色。本文意在为这一方向的未来工作提供一个框架。为推动此进程，相关代码已开源发布。

Abstract:Annual Reports of publicly listed companies contain vital information about their financial health which can help assess the potential impact on Stock price of the firm. These reports are comprehensive in nature, going up to, and sometimes exceeding, 100 pages. Analysing these reports is cumbersome even for a single firm, let alone the whole universe of firms that exist. Over the years, financial experts have become proficient in extracting valuable information from these documents relatively quickly. However, this requires years of practice and experience. This paper aims to simplify the process of assessing Annual Reports of all the firms by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The insights generated by the LLM are compiled in a Quant styled dataset and augmented by historical stock price data. A Machine Learning model is then trained with LLM outputs as features. The walkforward test results show promising outperformance wrt S&P500 returns. This paper intends to provide a framework for future work in this direction. To facilitate this, the code has been released as open source.
