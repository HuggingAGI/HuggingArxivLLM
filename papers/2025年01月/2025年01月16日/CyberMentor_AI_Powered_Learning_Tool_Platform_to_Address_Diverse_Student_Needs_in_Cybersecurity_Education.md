> CyberMentor: AI Powered Learning Tool Platform to Address Diverse Student Needs in Cybersecurity Education

# 摘要

> 许多网络安全专业的非传统学生常常难以获得来自同龄人、家人和教授的建议，这影响了他们的学习体验。此外，由于内容相关性、建议的本地性、最低专业知识和时机等问题，这些学生可能无法充分利用基于LLM的AI助手。为此，我们开发了CyberMentor平台，旨在通过回答与知识、技能和职业准备相关的问题，为这些学生提供全面支持。该平台由智能工作流和生成式大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动，利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术实现精准且上下文相关的信息检索，确保可访问性和个性化。我们展示了CyberMentor在满足网络安全教育知识需求、提升职业竞争力、解决分析和编程作业技能需求以及提供实时按需学习支持方面的价值。通过三个使用场景，我们展示了其在知识获取、职业准备以及无缝技能指导方面的作用。我们还采用LangChain的提示评估方法，验证了平台在帮助性、正确性和完整性方面的卓越表现。这些结果表明，CyberMentor不仅能帮助学生掌握实用网络安全技能，还能提升高等教育的公平性和可持续性。此外，其开源设计使其能够适应其他学科，推动教育创新并扩大其潜在影响力。

> Many non-traditional students in cybersecurity programs often lack access to advice from peers, family members and professors, which can hinder their educational experiences. Additionally, these students may not fully benefit from various LLM-powered AI assistants due to issues like content relevance, locality of advice, minimum expertise, and timing. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing an application designed to provide comprehensive support by answering questions related to knowledge, skills, and career preparation advice tailored to the needs of these students. We developed a learning tool platform, CyberMentor, to address the diverse needs and pain points of students majoring in cybersecurity. Powered by agentic workflow and Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval to achieve accessibility and personalization. We demonstrated its value in addressing knowledge requirements for cybersecurity education and for career marketability, in tackling skill requirements for analytical and programming assignments, and in delivering real time on demand learning support. Using three use scenarios, we showcased CyberMentor in facilitating knowledge acquisition and career preparation and providing seamless skill-based guidance and support. We also employed the LangChain prompt-based evaluation methodology to evaluate the platform's impact, confirming its strong performance in helpfulness, correctness, and completeness. These results underscore the system's ability to support students in developing practical cybersecurity skills while improving equity and sustainability within higher education. Furthermore, CyberMentor's open-source design allows for adaptation across other disciplines, fostering educational innovation and broadening its potential impact.
