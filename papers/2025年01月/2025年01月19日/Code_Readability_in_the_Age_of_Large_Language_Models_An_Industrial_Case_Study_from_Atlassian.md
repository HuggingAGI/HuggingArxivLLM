# 摘要

> 程序员在软件开发中花费大量时间阅读代码，而LLM自动生成代码的出现进一步加剧了这一趋势。然而，关于LLM生成代码的可读性及其在新时代的重要性，我们仍知之甚少。本文通过调查从业者对LLM时代代码可读性的看法，并对比基于LLM的软件开发框架HULA生成的代码与人类编写的代码，探讨其可读性。研究发现：（1）可读性仍是软件开发的关键；（2）LLM生成的代码可读性与人类代码相当，有助于建立信任并推动LLM驱动的开发平台广泛应用。

> Programmers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process. This trend is amplified by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.
