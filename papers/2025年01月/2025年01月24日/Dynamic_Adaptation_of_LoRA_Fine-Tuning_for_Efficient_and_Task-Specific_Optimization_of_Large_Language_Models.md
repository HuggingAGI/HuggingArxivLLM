> Dynamic Adaptation of LoRA Fine-Tuning for Efficient and Task-Specific Optimization of Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种新颖的大型语言模型微调方法——动态LoRA。该方法在标准低秩适应框架的基础上，引入了动态适应机制，以提升效率和性能。动态LoRA的核心创新在于其自适应权重分配机制，结合了基于输入特征的自适应策略，使得微调过程更加精准，更贴合特定任务的需求。与传统的静态LoRA方法不同，动态LoRA能够在微调过程中动态评估各层的重要性，从而重新分配适配器参数，优化任务表现。此外，动态LoRA还考虑了输入特征的分布，增强了模型在复杂多样数据集上的泛化能力。实验表明，动态LoRA在GLUE等基准数据集上表现出色，准确率达到88.1%，F1分数为87.3%，且仅比标准LoRA多消耗0.1%的计算资源。这种性能与效率的平衡，使动态LoRA成为资源受限场景下LLM微调的理想选择。其强大的适应性还为多模态任务等高级应用奠定了坚实基础。

> This paper presents a novel methodology of fine-tuning for large language models-dynamic LoRA. Building from the standard Low-Rank Adaptation framework, this methodology further adds dynamic adaptation mechanisms to improve efficiency and performance. The key contribution of dynamic LoRA lies within its adaptive weight allocation mechanism coupled with an input feature-based adaptive strategy. These enhancements allow for a more precise fine-tuning process that is more tailored to specific tasks. Traditional LoRA methods use static adapter settings, not considering the different importance of model layers. In contrast, dynamic LoRA introduces a mechanism that dynamically evaluates the layer's importance during fine-tuning. This evaluation enables the reallocation of adapter parameters to fit the unique demands of each individual task, which leads to better optimization results. Another gain in flexibility arises from the consideration of the input feature distribution, which helps the model generalize better when faced with complicated and diverse datasets. The joint approach boosts not only the performance over each single task but also the generalization ability of the model. The efficiency of the dynamic LoRA was validated in experiments on benchmark datasets, such as GLUE, with surprising results. More specifically, this method achieved 88.1% accuracy with an F1-score of 87.3%. Noticeably, these improvements were made at a slight increase in computational costs: only 0.1% more resources than standard LoRA. This balance between performance and efficiency positions dynamic LoRA as a practical, scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. To take it a step further, its adaptability makes it a promising foundation for much more advanced applications, including multimodal tasks.
