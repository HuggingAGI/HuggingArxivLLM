# 摘要

> 个性化教育是能够从人工智能（AI）和大型语言模型（LLM）最新进展中获益匪浅的领域之一。然而，要在个性化学习体验的同时有效教学，以适应独立学习者，其复杂认知需求也使其成为最具挑战性的应用之一。我们假设，采用\emph{心智社会}是应对这一挑战的有前途的方法。在本章中，我们介绍了TrueReason，这是一个个性化的学习系统典范，它整合了多种专门的AI模型，这些模型可以模拟微技能，由LLM将这些微技能组合起来以实现规划和推理的 operationalisation。我们介绍了初始原型的架构，并描述了已在原型中集成的两种微技能。所提出的系统展示了构建能够承担教育等复杂认知任务的复杂AI系统的初步尝试。

> Personalised education is one of the domains that can greatly benefit from the most recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). However, it is also one of the most challenging applications due to the cognitive complexity of teaching effectively while personalising the learning experience to suit independent learners. We hypothesise that one promising approach to excelling in such demanding use cases is using a \emph{society of minds}. In this chapter, we present TrueReason, an exemplar personalised learning system that integrates a multitude of specialised AI models that can mimic micro skills that are composed together by a LLM to operationalise planning and reasoning. The architecture of the initial prototype is presented while describing two micro skills that have been incorporated in the prototype. The proposed system demonstrates the first step in building sophisticated AI systems that can take up very complex cognitive tasks that are demanded by domains such as education.
