# 摘要

> 企业运营 heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews，以支持决策并发现机会。然而，传统的手动数据提取方法通常耗时且资源密集，促使企业采用数字化转型举措以提高效率。然而，对于这些举措的可持续性以及它们与联合国（UN）可持续发展目标（SDGs）的契合度，仍存在担忧。本研究旨在探索将大型语言模型（LLMs）与检索增强生成（RAG）相结合，作为信息提取（IE）和处理的可持续解决方案。研究方法包括审查现有的商业决策支持系统，发现许多系统需要训练新的机器学习模型，这不仅资源密集，还对环境产生重大影响。相反，我们提出了一种可持续的商业解决方案，利用现有的LLMs来处理多样化的数据集。通过将特定领域的数据集与LLMs关联，使其适应公司需求，并采用多智能体架构将信息检索、丰富和分类等任务分配给专门的智能体，从而优化提取过程并提升整体效率。通过这些技术的应用，企业可以优化资源利用，改善决策流程，并为可持续发展目标做出贡献，从而在企业界促进环境责任。

> Businesses heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews to drive their operations, enabling informed decision-making and identifying opportunities. However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.
