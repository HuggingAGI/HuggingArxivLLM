# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）与IT运维管理（ITOM）的融合，即AIOps，为工作流自动化、效率提升和决策支持带来了巨大潜力。然而，AI在IT运维中的应用并非一帆风顺，数据质量、环境复杂性和团队技能差距等问题依然存在。大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现为解决这些挑战提供了新思路，尤其是其强大的自然语言理解能力。这些能力使组织能够高效处理和分析系统日志、事件报告和技术文档等非结构化数据。我们的研究旨在将传统预测性机器学习模型与生成式AI技术（如LLMs）相结合，提出创新方法以应对AIOps中的长期挑战，并提升IT运维管理的能力。

> The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into IT Operations Management (ITOM), commonly referred to as AIOps, offers substantial potential for automating workflows, enhancing efficiency, and supporting informed decision-making. However, implementing AI within IT operations is not without its challenges, including issues related to data quality, the complexity of IT environments, and skill gaps within teams. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address some of these challenges, particularly through their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These features enable organizations to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, such as system logs, incident reports, and technical documentation. This ability aligns with the motivation behind our research, where we aim to integrate traditional predictive machine learning models with generative AI technologies like LLMs. By combining these approaches, we propose innovative methods to tackle persistent challenges in AIOps and enhance the capabilities of IT operations management.
