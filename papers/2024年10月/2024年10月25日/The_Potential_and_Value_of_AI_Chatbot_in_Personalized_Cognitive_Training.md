# 摘要

> 近年来，全球人口快速老龄化，致使像阿尔茨海默病之类的认知障碍增多，给公共卫生带来重大挑战。虽然当下尚无有效疗法逆转阿尔茨海默病，但预防和早期干预（包括认知训练）至关重要。本报告探究了 AI 聊天机器人在强化个性化认知训练方面的潜力。我们推出了 ReMe，这是一个基于网络的框架，旨在创建能助力认知训练研究的 AI 聊天机器人，专门针对源自个人生活日志的情景记忆任务。借助大型语言模型，ReMe 提供了更优的用户友好型、交互性和个性化的训练体验。案例研究显示，ReMe 通过生活回忆和开放式语言谜题有效地吸引了用户，凸显了其在优化认知训练设计方面的潜力。尽管成果喜人，但仍需进一步研究，通过包含认知能力评估的大规模研究来验证训练成效。总之，ReMe 为个性化认知训练提供了颇具前景的途径，利用 AI 能力满足认知健康中非药物干预不断增长的需求，未来的研究旨在拓展其应用范围和功效。

> In recent years, the rapid aging of the global population has led to an increase in cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, presenting significant public health challenges. Although no effective treatments currently exist to reverse Alzheimer's, prevention and early intervention, including cognitive training, are critical. This report explores the potential of AI chatbots in enhancing personalized cognitive training. We introduce ReMe, a web-based framework designed to create AI chatbots that facilitate cognitive training research, specifically targeting episodic memory tasks derived from personal life logs. By leveraging large language models, ReMe provides enhanced user-friendly, interactive, and personalized training experiences. Case studies demonstrate ReMe's effectiveness in engaging users through life recall and open-ended language puzzles, highlighting its potential to improve cognitive training design. Despite promising results, further research is needed to validate training effectiveness through large-scale studies that include cognitive ability evaluations. Overall, ReMe offers a promising approach to personalized cognitive training, utilizing AI capabilities to meet the growing demand for non-pharmacological interventions in cognitive health, with future research aiming to expand its applications and efficacy.
