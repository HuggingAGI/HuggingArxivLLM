> ChatGPT自2022年底问世以来，便点燃了人们对大型语言模型（LLMs）及更广泛人工智能（AI）解决方案的浓厚兴趣。随着这股AI新浪潮渗透社会各个领域，我们也在不断发掘现有AI工具的潜力与局限。
  计算机科学教育（CSEd）领域的调整需求尤为迫切：LLM已成为核心编码工具，模糊了编程辅助与智能系统的界限，同时凸显了CSEd作为技术与教学法交汇点的关键地位。我们的调查显示，尽管AI技术有望通过个性化学习路径、智能辅导系统和自动评估等方式优化学习体验，但也带来了新的隐忧——过度依赖技术、基础认知技能退化，以及公平获取创新成果的难题。
  近期的进展标志着一场范式转变，它不仅改变了教学内容，更重塑了教与学的模式。教育机构不应将适应AI技术的压力转嫁给学生，而需主动肩负起验证、整合与应用新教学方法的责任。唯有如此，才能确保教育者与学习者都具备驾驭由技术创新所塑造的、日新月异的教育生态所需的能力。

> Since its launch in late 2022, ChatGPT has ignited widespread interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and broader Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. As this new wave of AI permeates various sectors of society, we are continually uncovering both the potential and the limitations of existing AI tools.
  The need for adjustment is particularly significant in Computer Science Education (CSEd), as LLMs have evolved into core coding tools themselves, blurring the line between programming aids and intelligent systems, and reinforcing CSEd's role as a nexus of technology and pedagogy. The findings of our survey indicate that while AI technologies hold potential for enhancing learning experiences, such as through personalized learning paths, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated assessments, there are also emerging concerns. These include the risk of over-reliance on technology, the potential erosion of fundamental cognitive skills, and the challenge of maintaining equitable access to such innovations.
  Recent advancements represent a paradigm shift, transforming not only the content we teach but also the methods by which teaching and learning take place. Rather than placing the burden of adapting to AI technologies on students, educational institutions must take a proactive role in verifying, integrating, and applying new pedagogical approaches. Such efforts can help ensure that both educators and learners are equipped with the skills needed to navigate the evolving educational landscape shaped by these technological innovations.
