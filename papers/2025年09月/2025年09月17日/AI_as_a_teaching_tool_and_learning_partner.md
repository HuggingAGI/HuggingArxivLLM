# 摘要

> AI工具，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）的问世，为教学带来了变革性影响，各机构也在积极探索如何将LLMs建设性地融入教育。本文探讨了将基于LLM的工具应用于两个教学项目（一个本科项目和一个研究生项目）的实践：我们为学生提供了两类工具——（1）基于RAG技术、可访问课程材料的LLM驱动聊天机器人；（2）每周教学内容的AI生成纯音频播客。学期末，我们通过问卷调查了学生对这些工具的态度。参与调查的班级规模较小，均为生物相关课程。结果显示，学生们总体对AI持积极态度，认为AI工具为教学带来了正面影响：LLM聊天机器人因使用便捷、体验良好而深受喜爱，学生普遍认为它提升了学习效果；相比之下，播客的受欢迎度较低，仅有少数学生每周收听。班级整体对播客是否在更多课程中推广持中立态度，但定期收听的学生普遍喜欢并支持继续使用。

> The arrival of AI tools and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a transformative impact on teaching and learning and institutes are still trying to determine how to integrate LLMs into education in constructive ways. Here, we explore the adoption of LLM-based tools into two teaching programmes, one undergraduate and one postgraduate. We provided to our classes (1) a LLM-powered chatbot that had access to course materials by RAG and (2) AI-generated audio-only podcasts for each week$\text{'}$s teaching material. At the end of the semester, we surveyed the classes to gauge attitudes towards these tools. The classes were small and from biological courses. The students felt positive about AI generally and that AI tools made a positive impact on teaching. Students found the LLM-powered chatbot easy and enjoyable to use and felt that it enhanced their learning. The podcasts were less popular and only a small proportion of the class listened weekly. The class as a whole was indifferent to whether the podcasts should be used more widely across courses, but those who listened enjoyed them and were in favour.
