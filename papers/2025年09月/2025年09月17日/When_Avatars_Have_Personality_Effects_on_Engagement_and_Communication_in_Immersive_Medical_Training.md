> When Avatars Have Personality: Effects on Engagement and Communication in Immersive Medical Training

# 摘要

> 虚拟现实（VR）虽擅长模拟物理环境，但在训练复杂人际交往技能时，却因缺乏心理层面可信的虚拟人而效果受限。这一缺口在医疗教育等高风险领域尤为关键——毕竟在这些领域，沟通是核心能力。本文提出一种框架，通过将大型语言模型（LLMs）融入沉浸式VR，构建出医学逻辑连贯、个性鲜明且稳定的虚拟患者；该框架采用模块化架构，将个性与临床数据解耦。我们通过混合方法的受试者内研究对系统进行了评估，受试者为参与模拟咨询的持照医生。结果显示，该方法不仅切实可行，还被医生视为极具价值且高效的培训辅助工具。此外，研究分析还揭示了关键设计原则，其中包括“真实感-冗长悖论”：沟通越少的智能体反而可能更显虚假；同时，挑战需被感知为真实情境，才能发挥指导作用。这项研究为开发下一代具备社交智能的VR培训环境，提供了经过验证的框架与关键洞见。

> While virtual reality (VR) excels at simulating physical environments, its effectiveness for training complex interpersonal skills is limited by a lack of psychologically plausible virtual humans. This is a critical gap in high-stakes domains like medical education, where communication is a core competency. This paper introduces a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into immersive VR to create medically coherent virtual patients with distinct, consistent personalities, built on a modular architecture that decouples personality from clinical data. We evaluated our system in a mixed-method, within-subjects study with licensed physicians who engaged in simulated consultations. Results demonstrate that the approach is not only feasible but is also perceived by physicians as a highly rewarding and effective training enhancement. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers critical design principles, including a ``realism-verbosity paradox" where less communicative agents can seem more artificial, and the need for challenges to be perceived as authentic to be instructive. This work provides a validated framework and key insights for developing the next generation of socially intelligent VR training environments.
