> Uncertainty in Authorship: Why Perfect AI Detection Is Mathematically Impossible

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）日益精进，人类撰写与AI生成的文本愈发难以分辨。本文从概念层面将量子不确定性与自然语言中的作者身份检测局限进行类比，提出了一个核心观点：这里存在根本性的权衡——越是笃定地想分辨文本出自人类还是AI之手，就越可能破坏文本的自然流畅与本真质感。这恰似量子系统中精度与干扰的矛盾张力。我们深入探讨了当前检测方法（如文体分析、水印技术及神经分类器）的固有局限：提升检测精度常会改变AI的输出结果，进而降低其他特征的可信度。事实上，检测AI作者身份的行为本身就会给文本其他方面带来不确定性。分析显示，当AI生成文本高度模仿人类写作时，完美检测不仅技术上极具挑战，理论上更是天方夜谭。我们还回应了相关反驳意见，并探讨了其对作者身份、伦理及政策的深远影响。归根结底，AI文本检测的挑战并非仅仅是工具升级那么简单——它揭示了语言本质中一种更深层、无法规避的内在矛盾。

> As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text. Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing, perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.
