> Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare

# 摘要

> 医疗与医学是典型的多模态学科，需处理多模态数据以完成疾病推理与诊断。尽管科学领域已涌现出不少用于复杂任务推理的多模态模型，但这些模型在医疗场景的应用仍有局限，尤其在诊断推理的准确性上表现欠佳。为解决多模态医疗推理的诊断准确性难题并辅助医护人员，本研究提出了一种基于有向图的新型时间图推理机制。该机制能通过回溯调整、优化推理逻辑、新增或删减理由等方式适应动态变化，从而生成最优诊断建议。同时，纳入不同时间点的多模态数据可有效追踪和分析患者健康状况及疾病发展过程。此外，所设计的多智能体时间推理框架还具备任务分配与交叉验证功能，可进一步提升推理结果的精度。初步实验与分析结果验证了该方法的创新性和实际应用价值。

> Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.
