> HLSMAC: A New StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge for High-Level Strategic Decision-Making

# 摘要

> 基准测试是评估多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法的关键。虽然星际争霸II相关环境推动了MARL的显著进步，但SMAC等现有基准测试主要聚焦微观操作，难以全面评估智能体的高层战略智慧。为此，我们推出HLSMAC——一个全新的协作式MARL基准测试，它基于《三十六计》中的经典计谋，精心设计了12个星际争霸II场景。每个场景对应特定计谋，通过战术机动、时间协调、欺骗等多样化战略元素考验智能体，为评估高层战略决策能力开辟了新方向。我们还提出了超越传统胜率的多维度新指标（如能力利用率和推进效率），用于评估智能体在HLSMAC环境中的综合表现。我们将最先进的MARL算法和基于LLM的智能体融入该基准测试，并开展了全面实验。结果显示，HLSMAC是推动多智能体战略决策研究的可靠测试平台。

> Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.
