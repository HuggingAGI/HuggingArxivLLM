> Towards the Next Generation of Software: Insights from Grey Literature on AI-Native Applications

# 摘要

> 背景：大型语言模型（LLMs）的飞速发展催生了AI原生应用——这是软件工程领域的全新范式，从根本上重塑了软件的设计、开发与演进模式。尽管这类应用日益普及，却仍缺乏统一的工程定义和架构蓝图，使得从业者在系统设计、质量保障及技术选型时缺乏系统性指导。
  目标：本研究旨在全面理解AI原生应用，具体包括识别其定义特征、关键质量属性和典型技术栈，并阐明其带来的机遇与挑战。
  方法：我们开展了灰色文献综述，整合了通过谷歌和必应定向搜索获得的概念视角，以及从GitHub上主流开源项目中提炼的实践洞见。研究采用包含来源筛选、质量评估和主题分析的结构化方案，对不同来源的结果进行综合分析。
  结果：根据筛选标准，我们最终纳入106项研究。分析显示，AI原生应用的核心特征体现在两大支柱：一是AI作为系统智能范式的核心地位，二是其固有的概率性与非确定性本质。关键质量属性包括可靠性、可用性、性能效率及AI特有的可观测性。此外，典型技术栈已逐渐形成，涵盖LLM编排框架、向量数据库和AI原生可观测性平台。这类系统注重响应质量、成本效益和结果可预测性，与传统软件系统形成鲜明差异。
  结论：本研究首次提出双层工程蓝图……

> Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved. Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and technology selection.
  Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the opportunities and challenges they present.
  Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.
  Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria. The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge, comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality, cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from conventional software systems.
  Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering blueprint...
