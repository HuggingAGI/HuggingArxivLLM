> GView: A Survey of Binary Forensics via Visual, Semantic, and AI-Enhanced Analysis

# 摘要

> 网络安全威胁的表现形式日益复杂多样，数量与复杂性也随之攀升。为应对这些挑战，我们推出了GView——一个集可视化与AI增强推理于一体的开源取证分析框架。该框架最初聚焦于网络安全行业的实际应用，如今已取得显著发展：通过整合大型语言模型（LLMs）动态增强推理能力，同时简化取证工作流程。本文综述了GView的现状，涵盖其已发表论文及尚在出版流程中的研究成果。此外，GView还创新性地利用谓词与推理规则，对分析文档和用户操作进行逻辑推理，从而提供更优建议。我们着重介绍了其可扩展架构，凸显其作为实际取证领域与学术研究之间桥梁的潜力。

> Cybersecurity threats continue to become more sophisticated and diverse in their artifacts, boosting both their volume and complexity. To overcome those challenges, we present GView, an open-source forensic analysis framework with visual and AI-enhanced reasoning. It started with focus on the practical cybersecurity industry. It has evolved significantly, incorporating large language models (LLMs) to dynamically enhance reasoning and ease the forensic workflows. This paper surveys both the current state of GView with its published papers alongside those that are in the publishing process. It also includes its innovative use of logical inference through predicates and inference rules for both the analyzed documents and the user's actions for better suggestions. We highlight the extensible architecture, showcasing its potential as a bridge between the practical forensics worlds with the academic research.
