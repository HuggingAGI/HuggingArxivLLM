> Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey

# 摘要

> 轨迹预测是自动驾驶的核心功能，它能预测车辆、行人等交通参与者的未来运动路径，对保障驾驶安全至关重要。尽管传统深度学习方法提升了预测精度，但仍存在固有局限：可解释性不足、过度依赖大规模标注数据，以及在长尾场景下泛化能力较弱。大型基础模型（LFMs）的崛起正重塑轨迹预测的研究范式。本综述系统梳理了大型基础模型（尤其是用于轨迹预测的大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs））的最新进展。大型基础模型通过融合语言与场景语义，实现了可解释的上下文推理，大幅提升了复杂环境下的预测安全性和泛化能力。本文重点阐述了三大核心方法：轨迹-语言映射、多模态融合与基于约束的推理。内容涵盖车辆与行人的预测任务、评估指标及数据集分析。文章还探讨了计算延迟、数据稀缺性和现实世界鲁棒性等关键挑战，并展望了低延迟推理、因果感知建模和运动基础模型等未来研究方向。

> Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.
