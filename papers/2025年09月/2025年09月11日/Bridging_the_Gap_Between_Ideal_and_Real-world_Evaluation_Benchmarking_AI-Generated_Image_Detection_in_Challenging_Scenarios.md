> Bridging the Gap Between Ideal and Real-world Evaluation: Benchmarking AI-Generated Image Detection in Challenging Scenarios

# 摘要

> 随着生成式模型的飞速发展，高度逼真的图像合成技术给数字安全和媒体可信度带来了新的挑战。尽管AI生成图像检测方法已部分缓解了这些担忧，但在复杂现实场景下评估其性能仍存在显著研究空白。为此，本文提出了现实世界鲁棒性数据集（RRDataset），旨在从三个维度对检测模型进行全面评估：1）场景泛化性：RRDataset涵盖七个主要场景（战争与冲突、灾难与事故、政治社会事件、医疗公共卫生、文化宗教、劳动生产及日常生活）的高质量图像，从内容层面填补了现有数据集的空白。2）网络传播鲁棒性：测试在各类社交媒体平台经多轮分享后图像的检测器性能。3）重数字化鲁棒性：评估经四种不同重数字化方式处理后图像的模型检测效果。我们在RRDataset上对17种检测器和10种视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行了基准测试，并开展了192人参与的大规模人类实验，以探究人类在AI生成图像检测中的少样本学习能力。测试结果表明，现有AI检测方法在现实场景中存在局限性，同时强调了需借鉴人类适应性来开发更鲁棒的检测算法。

> With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility. Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.
