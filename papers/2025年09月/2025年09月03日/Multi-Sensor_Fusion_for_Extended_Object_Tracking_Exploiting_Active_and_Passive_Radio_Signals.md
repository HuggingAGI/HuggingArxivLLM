# 摘要

> 无线电设备的可靠稳健定位一直是个难题，多径传播、硬件缺陷及其他无线电发射机的干扰都会带来挑战。而一个常被忽视却至关重要的因素是智能体本身——比如携带设备的用户，它可能会阻挡到基站（锚点）的视距（LOS）链路。本文针对智能体部分阻挡视距链路场景下的精确定位问题展开研究：将智能体建模为会散射、衰减和阻挡无线电信号的扩展对象（EO），提出一种贝叶斯方法，融合“主动”测量（设备与锚点间）和“被动”多基地雷达型测量（锚点间经EO反射）。为解决测量源不确定性，我们引入多传感器多测量概率数据关联（PDA）算法，联合融合所有EO相关测量。此外，还针对人类用户等智能体开发了专用EO模型，考虑身体表面的多次散射反射，并提出简化变体以实现低复杂度部署。通过合成与真实无线电测量数据的评估表明，所提算法优于基于点目标假设的传统PDA方法，尤其在视距受阻（OLOS）期间及之后表现更为突出。

> Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with ``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.
