> All Models Are Wrong, But Can They Be Useful? Lessons from COVID-19 Agent-Based Models: A Systematic Review

# 摘要

> COVID-19大流行推动了大量计算模型的涌现，用于模拟疾病动态并指导干预措施。基于智能体的模型（ABMs）善于捕捉人群与环境的异质性，但其快速应用也引发了人们对其卫生政策实用性的质疑。我们对2020年1月至2023年12月发表的536项COVID-19 ABM研究进行了系统综述，这些研究于2024年1月30日检索自Web of Science、PubMed和Wiley数据库。纳入标准为使用ABMs模拟COVID-19传播的研究，综述类文献未被纳入。研究依据九项模型实用性标准展开评估，包括透明度与复用性、跨学科合作与利益相关者参与以及评估实践等。

研究发表量在2021年底达到峰值，且主要集中在少数国家。多数模型聚焦于行为或政策干预措施（n=294，54.85%），仅有极少数用于实时预测（n=9，1.68%）。尽管91.60%（n=491）的研究描述了模型假设，但仅有65.11%（n=349）披露了局限性，40.86%（n=219）共享了代码，36.38%（n=195）基于现有模型构建。标准化报告协议（n=36，6.72%）和利益相关者参与（13.62%，n=73）均较为少见。仅2.24%（n=12）的研究阐述了全面验证框架，不过75.93%（n=407）的研究对不确定性进行了量化。

本综述的局限性在于非英文研究代表性不足、数据提取存在主观性、研究质量参差不齐，且可推广性有限。总体来看，COVID-19 ABMs发展迅速，但在透明度、可及性和参与式合作方面存在不足。为使ABMs在未来公共卫生危机中成为可靠的决策支持工具，亟需建立更严格的标准。

> The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in computational models to simulate disease dynamics and guide interventions. Agent-based models (ABMs) are well-suited to capture population and environmental heterogeneity, but their rapid deployment raised questions about utility for health policy. We systematically reviewed 536 COVID-19 ABM studies published from January 2020 to December 2023, retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, and Wiley on January 30, 2024. Studies were included if they used ABMs to simulate COVID-19 transmission, where reviews were excluded. Studies were assessed against nine criteria of model usefulness, including transparency and re-use, interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and evaluation practices. Publications peaked in late 2021 and were concentrated in a few countries. Most models explored behavioral or policy interventions (n = 294, 54.85%) rather than real-time forecasting (n = 9, 1.68%). While most described model assumptions (n = 491, 91.60%), fewer disclosed limitations (n = 349, 65.11%), shared code (n = 219, 40.86%), or built on existing models (n = 195, 36.38%). Standardized reporting protocols (n = 36, 6.72%) and stakeholder engagement were rare (13.62%, n = 73). Only 2.24% (n = 12) described a comprehensive validation framework, though uncertainty was often quantified (n = 407, 75.93%). Limitations of this review include underrepresentation of non-English studies, subjective data extraction, variability in study quality, and limited generalizability. Overall, COVID-19 ABMs advanced quickly, but lacked transparency, accessibility, and participatory engagement. Stronger standards are needed for ABMs to serve as reliable decision-support tools in future public health crises.
