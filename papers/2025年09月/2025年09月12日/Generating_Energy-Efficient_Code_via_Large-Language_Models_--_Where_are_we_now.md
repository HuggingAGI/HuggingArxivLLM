# 摘要

> 背景：大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起推动其在开发流程中广泛应用。目标：我们通过实证评估LLMs生成的Python代码与人类编写代码、绿色软件专家开发代码的能源效率差异。方法：我们基于EvoEval基准测试中的9个编码问题，使用6种主流LLM和4种提示技术生成363个解决方案，并与人类开发方案对比。能源消耗在服务器、个人电脑和树莓派三种硬件平台上测量，总时长约881小时（36.7天）。结果：人类解决方案在服务器上节能16%、树莓派上节能3%，而LLMs在个人电脑上的节能表现比人类开发者高出25%。提示技术无法持续实现节能，最节能的提示因硬件平台而异。绿色软件专家开发的代码在所有硬件平台上均比所有LLMs代码节能至少17%-30%。结论：尽管LLMs具备较强的代码生成能力，但生成的代码在节能性上均不及经验丰富的绿色软件开发者所编写的代码。这表明，目前开发节能Python代码仍高度依赖人类专业知识。

> Context. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy efficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code developed by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding problems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting techniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption is measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a Raspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16% more energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs outperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently lead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by hardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is consistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on all hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good code generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient than that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of today there is still a great need of human expertise for developing energy-efficient Python code.
