> ThreatGPT: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Public Safety through Threat Modeling

# 摘要

> 随着城市与社区日益智能化，交通控制中心、应急响应网络、公共交通等安全保障系统也愈发复杂。而复杂性的提升也带来了更严峻的安全威胁风险——这些威胁不仅会波及机器，更会切实影响人们的生命安全。为应对这一挑战，我们研发了ThreatGPT——一款智能体人工智能（AI）助手，专为帮助工程师、安全官员、政策制定者等人群理解并分析公共安全系统中的威胁而设计。用户无需具备深厚的网络安全专业背景，只需描述所关注的系统组件（如登录系统、数据存储、通信网络等）即可。随后，用户只需点击按钮，即可选用STRIDE、MITRE ATT&CK、CVE报告、NIST、CISA等主流框架对系统进行分析。ThreatGPT的独特之处在于它不只是提供威胁信息，更能像一位专业伙伴般协同工作：借助少样本学习技术，它能从案例中学习并生成智能威胁模型，精准定位潜在风险点、剖析攻击者的利用路径，并给出切实可行的防范建议。无论是守护城市基础设施，还是保障地方医疗服务，这款工具都能灵活适配用户需求。简言之，ThreatGPT融合人工智能与人类判断，让公共安全系统更趋稳固；它的设计初衷不仅是分析威胁，更是赋能人们——让他们能更快、更精准地理解威胁，更自信地采取行动。

> As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe, such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers, safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about, such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information, but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is designed not just to analyze threats, but to empower people to understand and act on them, faster, smarter, and with more confidence.
