> 机器学习（ML）模型有望变革军事战场，这也带来了将其快速应用于作战环境的巨大外部压力。然而，这些模型在部署全流程中易受多种对抗性攻击，可能削弱战场优势，这一点已得到广泛证实。其中一大类是隐私攻击（如模型反转）——攻击者可通过模型逆向工程获取信息，例如训练时使用的敏感数据。目前，模型反转攻击（MIAs）的风险量化能力研究不足，且缺乏自动化开发测试与评估（DT&E）工具及指标来衡量MIA造成的隐私泄露程度。当前DT&E流程面临诸多难题：ML模型反转结果可能难以人工解读，即便可解读也存在主观性，且反转质量难以量化。此外，由于需评估的ML模型架构和数据模态繁多，DT&E流程的扩展也颇具挑战。本研究提出一种新型DT&E工具，可量化MIA导致的数据隐私泄露风险，并引入四个对抗性风险维度来衡量隐私泄露。该DT&E pipeline将反转技术与视觉语言模型（VLMs）结合，在提升效果的同时实现可扩展分析。我们通过多种MIA技术及配置为零样本分类与图像描述的VLMs，验证了工具的有效性；并以军事应用中典型的图像分类任务为基准，采用计算机视觉领域多种最先进的MIA对pipeline进行了测试。总体而言，这一创新pipeline通过自动化方式提升了隐私泄露分析的有效性与可扩展性，从而扩展了当前模型反转DT&E的能力。

> Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.
