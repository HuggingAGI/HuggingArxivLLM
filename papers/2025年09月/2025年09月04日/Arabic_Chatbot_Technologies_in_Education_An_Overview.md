> Arabic Chatbot Technologies in Education: An Overview

# 摘要

> 近年来，人工智能（AI）的整体发展，尤其是自然语言处理（NLP）领域的进步，以及聊天机器人等应用的兴起，推动了它们在教育、医疗、旅游和客户服务等多个领域的落地。自COVID-19疫情以来，人们对这些数字技术的关注度不断提升，旨在实现并优化远程访问。在教育领域，电子学习系统已在全球范围内大规模普及。而大型语言模型（LLM）——如BERT（双向编码器表示来自Transformer）和GPT（生成式预训练Transformer）——的问世，更是让聊天机器人的应用愈发广泛。本研究对现有阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人展开调研，分析了它们所采用的方法、语言变体及性能评估指标等特征。研究发现，尽管英语等其他语言的聊天机器人已取得成功，但阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人中仅有少数采用现代技术，这凸显了该领域存在的研究空白。最后，我们探讨了这一领域未来的研究方向。

> The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.
