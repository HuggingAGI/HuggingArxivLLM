# 摘要

> 尽管人工智能系统的拟人化现象日益普遍，但在人机交互中，种族化带来的潜在影响尚未得到充分研究。本研究旨在探讨：当人们认为训练AI的数据存在种族化倾向（即AI是基于特定人群的数据训练而成）时，这种认知会如何影响人机合作。研究中，参与者通过Pig Chase游戏完成人机合作任务，不同自我报告人口统计学特征的参与者与被操纵感知种族身份的AI代理交互，从而评估社会文化视角对游戏决策的影响。游戏结束后，参与者填写问卷，说明游戏策略并评价AI队友的智能水平。行为数据分析显示，参与者的人口统计学特征及其与处理条件（即AI代理的感知人口统计学特征）的交互作用具有显著的统计效应。结果表明，非白人参与者对被赋予白人种族特征的AI评价显著优于被赋予黑人种族特征的AI；而黑人和白人参与者对对照组AI均持消极态度。此外，研究基于结果构建了采用ACT-R认知架构的基线认知模型，从认知层面以过程为基础解释参与者的观点，这一模型有助于深入理解影响游戏决策策略的因素。数据与认知建模结果共同揭示：我们需要进一步理解种族化（无论是显性还是隐性）对人机交互方式的影响机制。

> Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.
