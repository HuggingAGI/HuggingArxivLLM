> Chatbot To Help Patients Understand Their Health

# 摘要

> 患者需掌握积极参与自身护理的必要知识。为此，我们研发了NoteAid-Chatbot——一种对话式人工智能，它通过创新的“以对话促学习”框架提升患者理解能力。该框架基于多智能体大型语言模型（LLM）与强化学习（RL）架构构建，全程无需人工标注数据。NoteAid-Chatbot采用轻量级LLaMA 3.2 3B模型，训练分为两个阶段：首先利用医疗对话策略合成对话数据，对模型进行初始监督微调；随后在模拟医院出院场景中，根据患者理解评估结果设定奖励信号，开展强化学习。我们的评估涵盖全面的人类对齐测试与案例研究，结果显示：尽管未针对这些特质进行明确训练，NoteAid-Chatbot仍展现出患者教育所需的关键涌现行为，如表达清晰、内容相关及对话结构化。研究结果表明，即便是简单的基于近端策略优化（PPO）的奖励模型，也能成功训练轻量级特定领域聊天机器人，使其胜任多轮交互、整合多元教育策略并达成精细沟通目标。图灵测试证实，NoteAid-Chatbot的表现优于非专家人类。尽管目前聚焦医疗健康领域，我们提出的框架仍验证了低成本PPO强化学习在真实开放式对话场景中的可行性与应用前景，进而拓展了强化学习对齐方法的适用边界。

> Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL) setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains, broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.
