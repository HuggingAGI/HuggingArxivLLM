# 摘要

> 测量在量子计算机的信息处理与保护中不可或缺，还能在未测量的量子比特间诱导长程纠缠。然而，当测量后状态依赖于大量非确定性测量结果时，观察和利用先前测量诱导的纠缠便面临阻碍。在此，我们提出一种检测此类测量诱导纠缠的新方法。我们在超导量子处理器中构建了量子比特一维和二维阵列的短程纠缠态，旨在表征当测量所有其他量子比特后，远距离量子比特对之间产生的长程纠缠。为此，我们通过对观测结果进行神经网络无监督训练，构建测量后状态的计算模型，并将这些模型与实验数据关联，从而揭示测量诱导的纠缠。我们的研究结果还表明，经典智能体准确建模实验数据的能力会发生转变；这与测量诱导的相变密切相关。我们期望这项工作能为未来的量子纠错实验以及更广泛的量子控制问题研究奠定基础。

> Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.
