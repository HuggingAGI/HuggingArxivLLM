> LLMs4All: A Review on Large Language Models for Research and Applications in Academic Disciplines

# 摘要

> 尖端人工智能（AI）技术正不断重塑我们对世界的认知。以ChatGPT为代表的大型语言模型（LLMs）应用，已能在海量话题上生成媲美人类的对话。凭借在开放域问答、翻译、文档摘要等各类语言任务中的惊艳表现，LLMs有望通过客户服务、教育无障碍、科学发现等更广泛的现实应用，带来影响深远的变革。受此启发，本文将综述最先进的LLMs及其在多学科领域的融合应用，具体涵盖：（1）人文艺术与法学（如历史、哲学、政治学、艺术与建筑、法学）；（2）经济学与商学（如金融、经济、会计、市场营销）；（3）科学与工程（如数学、物理与机械工程、化学与化工、生命科学与生物工程、地球科学与土木工程、计算机科学与电气工程）。本文将人文与科技交融，探讨LLMs如何重塑这些领域的研究与实践，并深入讨论生成式AI时代的核心局限、待解难题与未来方向。对LLMs跨学科应用的梳理，辅以核心观察与洞见，将为有意借助LLMs推动多领域实际应用的研究者与从业者提供有益参考。

> Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.
