# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的兴起极大地推动了从政治学、软件开发到其他众多领域的解决方案进步。然而，这些模型受限于静态的训练数据，其信息仅涵盖截至特定日期的内容。此外，由于其泛化特性，模型通常需要针对分类或指令等特定目的进行微调，以有效执行下游任务。而以LLMs为核心的AI智能体则通过调用外部工具和实时数据，缓解了部分局限性，进而实现了实时天气播报、数据分析等应用。在工业场景中，AI智能体正通过强化决策、预测性维护和流程优化来革新运营模式。例如在制造业，AI智能体赋能近自主系统，不仅提升了生产效率，还支持实时决策。尽管优势显著，AI智能体仍面临安全威胁，如提示注入攻击，这对其完整性和可靠性构成严重风险。为应对这些挑战，本文提出将基于角色的访问控制（RBAC）集成到AI智能体中的框架，为其提供坚实的安全屏障。该框架旨在支持AI智能体的高效、可扩展部署，尤其聚焦本地实施场景。

> The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced solutions across various domains, from political science to software development. However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.
