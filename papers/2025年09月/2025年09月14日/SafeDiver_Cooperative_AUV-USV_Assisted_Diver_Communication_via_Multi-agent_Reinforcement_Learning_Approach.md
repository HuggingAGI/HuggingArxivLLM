> SafeDiver: Cooperative AUV-USV Assisted Diver Communication via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach

# 摘要

> 随着水下人类活动日益频繁，水下通信服务的需求面临严峻挑战。现有潜水员水下通信方式受自身缺陷及复杂水下环境限制，难以满足需求。为此，我们提出一种基于海上无人系统的方案，为潜水员提供可靠高速的通信支持。多艘自主水下航行器（AUVs）搭载光声多模态通信设备作为中继节点，可根据潜水员活动区域的变化提供自适应通信服务。采用多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法控制AUVs协同移动，可实现潜水员间高速可靠的数据传输。同时，借助无人水面艇（USVs）作为水面中继节点的按需部署与广覆盖能力，协调转发AUVs信息，并控制AUVs自适应选择中继USV节点传输数据，从而实现潜水员与水面平台的高质量通信。仿真结果表明，该方案可有效保障潜水员的可靠高速通信。

> As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.
