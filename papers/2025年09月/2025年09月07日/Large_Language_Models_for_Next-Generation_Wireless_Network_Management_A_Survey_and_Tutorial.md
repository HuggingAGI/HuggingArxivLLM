# 摘要

> 随着第六代（6G）无线网络的快速演进，资源分配、轨迹设计等优化问题的复杂度与规模急剧上升，这些问题常被建模为大型离散决策空间中的组合优化难题。然而，启发式方法、深度强化学习（DRL）等传统优化手段，难以满足日益异构化、资源受限网络环境中对实时适应性、可扩展性及用户意图动态处理的严苛要求。大型语言模型（LLMs）凭借先进的语义理解与结构化推理能力，实现了自然语言驱动的问题建模、上下文感知推理及自适应解优化，由此构建了变革性范式。本文系统全面地综述了面向无线网络的LLM优化框架：首先阐述了基础设计理念，并对比了基于LLM的方法与传统优化范式的核心差异；随后深入剖析了关键技术路径，包括自然语言建模、求解器协同及解验证机制；通过典型案例分析，展示了LLMs在优化建模、低空经济组网、意图组网等实际场景中的变革潜力。最后，本文探讨了当前研究面临的挑战，梳理了主流开源框架与数据集，并指明了未来发展方向，旨在为下一代无线网络打造稳健、可扩展且可信的LLM优化方案。

> The rapid advancement toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has significantly intensified the complexity and scale of optimization problems, including resource allocation and trajectory design, often formulated as combinatorial problems in large discrete decision spaces. However, traditional optimization methods, such as heuristics and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), struggle to meet the demanding requirements of real-time adaptability, scalability, and dynamic handling of user intents in increasingly heterogeneous and resource-constrained network environments. Large language models (LLMs) present a transformative paradigm by enabling natural language-driven problem formulation, context-aware reasoning, and adaptive solution refinement through advanced semantic understanding and structured reasoning capabilities. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled optimization frameworks tailored for wireless networks. We first introduce foundational design concepts and distinguish LLM-enabled methods from conventional optimization paradigms. Subsequently, we critically analyze key enabling methodologies, including natural language modeling, solver collaboration, and solution verification processes. Moreover, we explore representative case studies to demonstrate LLMs' transformative potential in practical scenarios such as optimization formulation, low-altitude economy networking, and intent networking. Finally, we discuss current research challenges, examine prominent open-source frameworks and datasets, and identify promising future directions to facilitate robust, scalable, and trustworthy LLM-enabled optimization solutions for next-generation wireless networks.
