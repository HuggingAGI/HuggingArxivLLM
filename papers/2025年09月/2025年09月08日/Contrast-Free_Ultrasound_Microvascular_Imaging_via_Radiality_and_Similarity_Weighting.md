# 摘要

> 随着超快数据采集技术的发展和杂波滤波算法的改进，微血管成像取得了显著进步，大幅提升了功率多普勒成像对小血管的检测灵敏度。但受限于空间分辨率不足和背景噪声偏高，图像的可视化效果与定量准确性仍有待提高。为此，本研究提出高分辨率互相关功率多普勒（HR-XPD）方法，通过整合空间径向加权与多普勒信号相干分析，在抑制伪影和背景噪声的同时有效提升空间分辨率。模拟实验及对健康人肝、移植人肾和猪肾的在体实验定量评估显示：与传统功率多普勒（PD）相比，HR-XPD显著改善了微血管的分辨能力和对比度。在体结果表明，其空间分辨率提升2至3倍，对比度增强高达20 dB，且仅需0.3秒至1.2秒的短采集时间，无需造影剂即可清晰呈现高分辨率血管细节。这些结果证实，HR-XPD是一种高效、无造影剂的高分辨率微血管成像技术，在临床前与临床研究中具有广泛应用前景。

> Microvascular imaging has advanced significantly with ultrafast data acquisition and improved clutter filtering, enhancing the sensitivity of power Doppler imaging to small vessels. However, the image quality remains limited by spatial resolution and elevated background noise, both of which impede visualization and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a high-resolution cross-correlation Power Doppler (HR-XPD) method that integrates spatial radiality weighting with Doppler signal coherence analysis, thereby enhancing spatial resolution while suppressing artifacts and background noise. Quantitative evaluations in simulation and in vivo experiments on healthy human liver, transplanted human kidney, and pig kidney demonstrated that HR-XPD significantly improves microvascular resolvability and contrast compared to conventional PD. In vivo results showed up to a 2 to 3-fold enhancement in spatial resolution and an increase in contrast by up to 20 dB. High-resolution vascular details were clearly depicted within a short acquisition time of only 0.3 s-1.2 s without the use of contrast agents. These findings indicate that HR-XPD provides an effective, contrast-free, and high-resolution microvascular imaging approach with broad applicability in both preclinical and clinical research.
