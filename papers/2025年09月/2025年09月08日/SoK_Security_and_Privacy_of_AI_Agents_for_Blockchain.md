> SoK: Security and Privacy of AI Agents for Blockchain

# 摘要

> 近年来，区块链和智能合约作为去中心化、无需信任的数字生态系统基石备受关注，由此不再需要传统的中心化机构。尽管二者在驱动Web3中扮演核心角色，但其复杂性仍给非专业用户带来了不小的使用门槛。为弥合这一鸿沟，基于人工智能（AI）的智能体应运而生，成为与区块链环境交互的得力工具，可支持从链上数据分析、交易策略优化到智能合约漏洞检测等各类任务。尽管AI与区块链融合的热度不断攀升，但现有文献中仍缺乏专门聚焦AI智能体交叉领域的全面综述。多数相关研究仅停留在泛泛而谈，并未针对特定领域展开深入探讨。本文通过构建首个专门面向区块链AI驱动系统的知识系统化（Systematization of Knowledge）来填补这一空白，重点关注其安全与隐私维度，并深入剖析了这类系统的应用场景、局限性及未来研究方向。

> Blockchain and smart contracts have garnered significant interest in recent years as the foundation of a decentralized, trustless digital ecosystem, thereby eliminating the need for traditional centralized authorities. Despite their central role in powering Web3, their complexity still presents significant barriers for non-expert users. To bridge this gap, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based agents have emerged as valuable tools for interacting with blockchain environments, supporting a range of tasks, from analyzing on-chain data and optimizing transaction strategies to detecting vulnerabilities within smart contracts. While interest in applying AI to blockchain is growing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey that focuses specifically on the intersection with AI agents. Most of the related work only provides general considerations, without focusing on any specific domain. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first Systematization of Knowledge dedicated to AI-driven systems for blockchain, with a special focus on their security and privacy dimensions, shedding light on their applications, limitations, and future research directions.
