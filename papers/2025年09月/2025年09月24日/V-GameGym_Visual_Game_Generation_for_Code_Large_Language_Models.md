> V-GameGym: Visual Game Generation for Code Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 代码大型语言模型在编程任务中已展现出卓越能力，但当前基准测试主要聚焦单一模态，而非视觉游戏开发。大多数现有代码相关基准测试仅评估语法正确性和执行准确性，却忽略了实际部署中至关重要的游戏特有指标，例如可玩性、视觉美感和用户参与度。为弥合当前LLM在算法问题解决和竞技编程方面的能力与实际游戏开发综合需求之间的差距，我们提出了V-GameGym——一个全面的基准测试。该基准包含来自真实仓库的100个主题集群、共2219个高质量样本，并采用新颖的基于聚类的筛选方法，以确保多样性和结构完整性。

> Code large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in programming tasks, yet current benchmarks primarily focus on single modality rather than visual game development. Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.
