> Feed-O-Meter: Fostering Design Feedback Skills through Role-playing Interactions with AI Mentee

# 摘要

> 有效的反馈（含批评与评估）能帮助设计师打磨概念、完善想法，并在整个迭代设计流程中支撑理性决策。但在工作室制设计课程中，学生常因缺乏自信、害怕被评判而怯于提供反馈，这制约了关键反馈技能的培养。大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展显示，与AI智能体进行角色扮演或能让学习者在无外界评判压力、不受现实时间限制的条件下开展多轮反馈练习。然而，已有研究指出，LLMs在角色扮演中难以模拟真人互动，这会削弱此类交流的教育价值。因此，要设计出能有效支持学习者练习和培养思辨推理能力的AI智能体，不能仅靠为其赋予目标角色的性格与身份。为此，我们研发了Feed-O-Meter——一个基于精心设计的LLM智能体构建的新型系统，专门为学生打造练习设计反馈的实践场景。该系统让用户化身为导师，向AI学员提供反馈，并能反思这些反馈如何影响AI学员的思路发展。一项涉及24名参与者的用户研究表明，Feed-O-Meter通过角色转换提升了参与者的投入度与积极性，还帮助他们调整反馈内容，使其对AI学员更通俗易懂。基于这些发现，我们探讨了设计教育中反馈技能培养系统的未来发展方向。

> Effective feedback, including critique and evaluation, helps designers develop design concepts and refine their ideas, supporting informed decision-making throughout the iterative design process. However, in studio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to a lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to develop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage in multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time constraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that LLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing the educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based agents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing intellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target persona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we present Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based agents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design feedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback to an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the AI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that Feed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through role-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an AI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing systems to foster feedback skills in design education.
