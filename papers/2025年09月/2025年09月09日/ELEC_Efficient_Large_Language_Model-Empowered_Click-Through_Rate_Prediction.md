> ELEC: Efficient Large Language Model-Empowered Click-Through Rate Prediction

# 摘要

> 点击率（CTR）预测是在线广告系统的核心任务。传统CTR预测模型通过特征交互捕捉表格数据的协同信号，却丢失了文本语义；而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽擅长理解文本上下文与含义，但在协同信号捕捉和推理速度上存在短板。为此，我们融合两类模型优势，提出兼顾协同性、语义理解与高效推理的ELEC框架——一个高效的LLM赋能CTR预测方案。我们首先将LLM适配到CTR预测任务，为平衡LLM能力与效率，设计了伪孪生网络结构：包含增益网络与基础网络。其中，增益网络通过注入LLM生成的高层表征向量与协同CTR模型结合，实现表格建模与文本建模的双重优势；但受LLM依赖限制，其效率不足。为此，我们通过分数层面与表征层面的知识蒸馏，将增益网络的知识迁移至基础网络。最终，仅以表格数据为输入的基础网络，性能可媲美增益网络。该方法具有模型无关性，可与多种现有LLMs及协同CTR模型灵活集成。真实数据集上的实验验证了ELEC在CTR预测任务中的有效性与高效性。

> Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency. We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ELEC for CTR prediction.
