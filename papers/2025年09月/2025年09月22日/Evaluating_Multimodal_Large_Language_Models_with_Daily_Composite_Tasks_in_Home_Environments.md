# 摘要

> 通用人工智能（AGI）与传统人工智能的核心区别在于，AGI能执行需多种能力协同的复合任务。尽管多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）驱动的具身智能体拥有丰富的感知与交互能力，但其解决复合任务的能力尚未得到充分研究。本研究受儿童早期发展阶段常见日常活动的启发，设计了一系列复合任务。在动态模拟的家庭环境中，这些任务覆盖物体理解、空间智能和社交活动三大核心领域。我们在这些任务上对17个主流的专有及开源MLLMs进行了评估，结果显示所有领域的表现均不理想，表明当前能力与通用智能的要求之间存在显著差距。综上，这些任务为评估具身智能体的通用能力提供了初步框架，也为具身MLLMs的发展及实际落地迈出了早期但关键的一步。

> A key feature differentiating artificial general intelligence (AGI) from traditional AI is that AGI can perform composite tasks that require a wide range of capabilities. Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it remains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.
