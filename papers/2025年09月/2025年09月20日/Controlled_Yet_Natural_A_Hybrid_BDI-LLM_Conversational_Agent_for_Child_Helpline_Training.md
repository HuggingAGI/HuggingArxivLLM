> Controlled Yet Natural: A Hybrid BDI-LLM Conversational Agent for Child Helpline Training

# 摘要

> 儿童求助热线培训常采用人工主导的角色扮演，这种方式不仅耗时，还耗费大量资源。为解决这一痛点，研究人员提出了基于规则的交互式智能体模拟，为新手咨询师打造结构化的培训场景。但这类智能体往往语言理解能力有限，且回复缺乏多样性。为突破这些局限，我们研发了一种混合交互式智能体，将大型语言模型（LLMs）融入基于规则的信念-愿望-意图（BDI）框架，能模拟更逼真的虚拟儿童对话场景。该混合方案将LLMs整合进三个核心模块：意图识别、回复生成及一个绕过机制。我们通过两项研究对该系统展开评估：一是基于脚本的测试，对比LLM生成的回复与人工撰写的回复；二是被试内实验（N=37），比较集成LLM的智能体与纯规则版智能体。第一项研究证实，三个LLM模块的表现并不逊色于人工撰写的回复。第二项研究则有力支持了两个假设：参与者认为集成LLM的智能体比纯规则智能体更可信，且对其持更积极的态度。此外，尽管支持度较弱，但数据显示参与度有提升趋势（后验概率=0.845，95% HDI [-0.149, 0.465]）。研究结果显示，将LLMs融入基于规则的系统极具潜力，为开发更灵活且可控的培训系统指明了方向。

> Child helpline training often relies on human-led roleplay, which is both time- and resource-consuming. To address this, rule-based interactive agent simulations have been proposed to provide a structured training experience for new counsellors. However, these agents might suffer from limited language understanding and response variety. To overcome these limitations, we present a hybrid interactive agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a rule-based Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework, simulating more realistic virtual child chat conversations. This hybrid solution incorporates LLMs into three components: intent recognition, response generation, and a bypass mechanism. We evaluated the system through two studies: a script-based assessment comparing LLM-generated responses to human-crafted responses, and a within-subject experiment (N=37) comparing the LLM-integrated agent with a rule-based version. The first study provided evidence that the three LLM components were non-inferior to human-crafted responses. In the second study, we found credible support for two hypotheses: participants perceived the LLM-integrated agent as more believable and reported more positive attitudes toward it than the rule-based agent. Additionally, although weaker, there was some support for increased engagement (posterior probability = 0.845, 95% HDI [-0.149, 0.465]). Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLMs into rule-based systems, offering a promising direction for more flexible but controlled training systems.
