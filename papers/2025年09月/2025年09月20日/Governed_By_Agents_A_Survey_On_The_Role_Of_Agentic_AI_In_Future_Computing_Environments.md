# 摘要

> 智能体人工智能（AI）的崛起——这类AI能自主运行、展现目标导向行为并自适应学习——预示着当今计算基础设施即将迎来巨变。本研究旨在探究智能体AI模型的多重特性会如何影响计算环境运行的架构、治理与运营机制。凭借资源高效性（尤其是在处理和/或存储环节），智能体AI有望降低对超大型（公共）云环境的依赖。上述特性为我们提供了契机，去审视计算基础设施从大型公共云服务向更本地化分布式架构（边缘计算与本地计算基础设施）进行战略迁移的可能性。这些潜在迁移中的多数将受到多种因素驱动，例如本地处理需求、数据消耗足迹的缩减以及成本节约。本研究还将考察：实现AI自主性的解决方案如何推动系统架构重构；如何构建有别于当前治理模型的新模型，以助力管理这些日益自主的智能体；以及如何对整合了云、边缘与本地计算解决方案的高度多样化计算系统环境中的流程进行运营革新。为了更好地探索这些相互交织的决策，关键在于理解如何为智能体AI进行最佳定位，以及如何驾驭计算基础设施的未来发展。

> The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can operate autonomously, demonstrate goal-directed behavior, and adaptively learn, indicates the onset of a massive change in today's computing infrastructure. This study investigates how agentic AI models' multiple characteristics may impact the architecture, governance, and operation under which computing environments function. Agentic AI has the potential to reduce reliance on extremely large (public) cloud environments due to resource efficiency, especially with processing and/or storage. The aforementioned characteristics provide us with an opportunity to canvas the likelihood of strategic migration in computing infrastructures away from massive public cloud services, towards more locally distributed architectures: edge computing and on-premises computing infrastructures. Many of these likely migrations will be spurred by factors like on-premises processing needs, diminished data consumption footprints, and cost savings. This study examines how a solution for implementing AI's autonomy could result in a re-architecture of the systems and model a departure from today's governance models to help us manage these increasingly autonomous agents, and an operational overhaul of processes over a very diverse computing systems landscape that bring together computing via cloud, edge, and on-premises computing solutions. To enable us to explore these intertwined decisions, it will be fundamentally important to understand how to best position agentic AI, and to navigate the future state of computing infrastructures.
