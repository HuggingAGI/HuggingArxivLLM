> MCP: A Control-Theoretic Orchestration Framework for Synergistic Efficiency and Interpretability in Multimodal Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 针对大型模型在多轮推理、多模态协作等复杂任务中存在的计算效率低、可解释性不足等问题，本研究提出了基于模型-控制器-任务适配（MCP）的三层协作框架。该框架将大型模型功能解耦为推理、生成与检索模块，结合强化学习驱动的动态路由算法及任务适配机制，首次实现了控制理论与大型模型动态推理的系统性融合。实验结果显示，MCP框架在GLUE、COCO、ScienceQA等跨模态基准任务上的性能较基线模型提升15-30%，推理效率提升40%，且通过Presenter层生成可解释的中间结果，人工可解释性评分达90%，为突破大型模型实际应用瓶颈提供了全新技术路径。

> Aiming at the problems of computational inefficiency and insufficient interpretability faced by large models in complex tasks such as multi-round reasoning and multi-modal collaboration, this study proposes a three-layer collaboration framework based on model-controller-task adaptation (MCP). By decoupling large model functions into reasoning, generation and retrieval modules, and combining reinforcement learning-driven dynamic routing algorithms and task adaptation mechanisms, the systematic integration of control theory and large model dynamic reasoning is achieved for the first time. Experiments show that the MCP framework improves the performance of cross-modal benchmarking tasks, such as GLUE, COCO, ScienceQA, etc., by 15-30% compared with the baseline model, improves the reasoning efficiency by 40%, and generates the interpretable intermediate results through the Presenter layer, obtaining 90% of the manual interpretability scores, which provides a brand-new technological path to solve the bottleneck of the practical application of the large model.
