# 摘要

> 大规模量子系统（尤其是量子模拟模拟器和兆量子比特量子计算机生成的系统）的高效表征，是量子科学的核心挑战——这源于希尔伯特空间随系统规模呈指数级扩展的特性。人工智能（AI）凭借其在高维模式识别与函数逼近上的卓越能力，最新进展已成为应对这一挑战的利器。目前，越来越多的研究借助AI对可扩展量子系统进行表示与表征，研究范围从理论基础延伸至实验实现。根据先验知识与学习架构的整合方式，AI与量子系统表征的融合可分为三种协同范式：机器学习，尤其是深度学习与语言模型。本综述探讨了上述每种AI范式如何助力量子系统表征的两大核心任务：量子性质预测与量子态替代模型构建。文章还探讨了该领域的关键挑战与开放性问题，并展望了AI与量子科学交叉领域的未来前景。

> Efficient characterization of large-scale quantum systems, especially those produced by quantum analog simulators and megaquop quantum computers, poses a central challenge in quantum science due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with respect to system size. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with its aptitude for high-dimensional pattern recognition and function approximation, have emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge. A growing body of research has leveraged AI to represent and characterize scalable quantum systems, spanning from theoretical foundations to experimental realizations. Depending on how prior knowledge and learning architectures are incorporated, the integration of AI into quantum system characterization can be categorized into three synergistic paradigms: machine learning, and, in particular, deep learning and language models. This review discusses how each of these AI paradigms contributes to two core tasks in quantum systems characterization: quantum property prediction and the construction of surrogates for quantum states. These tasks underlie diverse applications, from quantum certification and benchmarking to the enhancement of quantum algorithms and the understanding of strongly correlated phases of matter. Key challenges and open questions are also discussed, together with future prospects at the interface of AI and quantum science.
