> Integrating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Education: A Pilot Study through GitHub Repositories Mining

# 摘要

> 背景：ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程（SE）教育领域的应用日益广泛，既带来机遇，也伴随着挑战。要将其合理融入课程，需进行系统性研究。目标：本博士研究计划通过多阶段流程（涵盖分类体系构建、实证调研及案例分析），开发一套经过验证的LLMs与SE教育整合框架。本文呈现的是该研究的首个实证环节。方法：我们开展了一项试点仓库挖掘研究，选取400个GitHub项目，通过分析其README文件和问题讨论，识别先前在文献综述[ 8]中归纳的激励因素与阻碍因素。结果：激励因素中，参与度与学习积极性（227次提及）、软件工程流程理解（133次提及）以及编程辅助与调试支持（97次提及）最为突出；阻碍因素方面，抄袭与知识产权问题（385次提及）、安全隐私及数据完整性（87次提及）、学习中过度依赖AI（39次提及）也频繁出现。相比之下，评估学习成果的难度及课程重构挑战等阻碍因素在所有项目中均未被提及。结论：本研究从主题层面为激励因素与阻碍因素的分类体系提供了早期实证支持，揭示了研究与实践之间的差距，并为构建指导LLMs在SE教育中负责任应用的综合框架奠定了基础。

> Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly adopted in software engineering (SE) education, offering both opportunities and challenges. Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.
