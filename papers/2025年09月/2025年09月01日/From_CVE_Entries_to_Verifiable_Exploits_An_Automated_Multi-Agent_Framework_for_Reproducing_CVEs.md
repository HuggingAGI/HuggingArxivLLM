> From CVE Entries to Verifiable Exploits: An Automated Multi-Agent Framework for Reproducing CVEs

# 摘要

> High-quality datasets of real-world vulnerabilities and their corresponding verifiable exploits are crucial resources in software security research. Yet such resources remain scarce, as their creation demands intensive manual effort and deep security expertise. In this paper, we present CVE-GENIE, an automated, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework designed to reproduce real-world vulnerabilities, provided in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) format, to enable creation of high-quality vulnerability datasets. Given a CVE entry as input, CVE-GENIE gathers the relevant resources of the CVE, automatically reconstructs the vulnerable environment, and (re)produces a verifiable exploit. Our systematic evaluation highlights the efficiency and robustness of CVE-GENIE's design and successfully reproduces approximately 51% (428 of 841) CVEs published in 2024-2025, complete with their verifiable exploits, at an average cost of $2.77 per CVE. Our pipeline offers a robust method to generate reproducible CVE benchmarks, valuable for diverse applications such as fuzzer evaluation, vulnerability patching, and assessing AI's security capabilities.
