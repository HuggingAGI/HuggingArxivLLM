> TopoNav: Topological Graphs as a Key Enabler for Advanced Object Navigation

# 摘要

> <翻译失败>

> Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language models (LLMs), but still faces challenges in memory management, especially in long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections, adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.
