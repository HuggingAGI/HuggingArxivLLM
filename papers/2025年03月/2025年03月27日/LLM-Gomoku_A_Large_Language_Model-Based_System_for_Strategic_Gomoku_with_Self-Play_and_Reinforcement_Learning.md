# 摘要

> 近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，展现了强大的生成、理解和推理能力。这些模型已被应用于教育、智能决策和游戏等多个领域。然而，将大型语言模型有效应用于五子棋中的战略规划和决策制定仍具挑战。本研究旨在开发一个基于大型语言模型的五子棋AI系统，模拟人类学习下棋的过程。该系统旨在理解和运用五子棋策略与逻辑，以做出合理决策。研究方法包括使模型能够“读取棋盘”、“理解规则”、“选择策略”和“评估局面”，同时通过自对弈和强化学习提升其能力。结果显示，该方法显著提升了移动位置的选择能力，解决了生成非法位置的问题，并通过并行位置评估减少了处理时间。经过大量自对弈训练后，模型的五子棋下棋能力得到了显著提升。

> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.
