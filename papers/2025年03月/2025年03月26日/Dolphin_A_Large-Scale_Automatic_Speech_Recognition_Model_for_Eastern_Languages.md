# 摘要

> # 摘要
我们正式推出Dolphin——一款基于Whisper架构扩展的大型多语言自动语音识别（ASR）模型。通过整合内部专有和开源数据集，我们对Dolphin进行了精心优化。这款模型专注于提升东亚、南亚、东南亚及中东40种东方语言的识别精度，同时覆盖22种中文方言。实验结果表明，Dolphin在多种语言下显著超越现有最先进的开源模型。为了推动开放研究与创新，我们已公开发布了训练模型和推理代码。


> This report introduces Dolphin, a large-scale multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that extends the Whisper architecture to support a wider range of languages. Our approach integrates in-house proprietary and open-source datasets to refine and optimize Dolphin's performance. The model is specifically designed to achieve notable recognition accuracy for 40 Eastern languages across East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, while also supporting 22 Chinese dialects. Experimental evaluations show that Dolphin significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art open-source models across various languages. To promote reproducibility and community-driven innovation, we are making our trained models and inference source code publicly available.
