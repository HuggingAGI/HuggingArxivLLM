# 摘要

> 大型语言模型驱动的 AI 系统在现代社会蓬勃发展，通过自然语言交互实现了广泛应用。然而，随着 AI 代理在生活中的普及，其通用表达方式成为吸引力和采用度的瓶颈。个性表达是打造更人性、更独特的 AI 系统的关键。我们发现，借助心理学框架，AI 模型能够准确且一致地表达个性，其效果因模型能力而异。GPT-4o 和 o1 等先进模型在大五人格和迈尔斯-布里格斯评估中表现最佳，这得益于其智能与推理能力的结合。研究显示，个性表达依赖整体推理而非逐个问题优化，且在响应层面的波动大于测试层面。此外，模型微调对交流风格的影响独立于个性表达的准确性。这些发现为打造多样且一致个性的 AI 代理铺平了道路，这将极大提升教育、医疗等领域的交互体验，同时为创造更多独特 AI 代理提供了可能。定量评估个性表达的能力也为研究更可靠、更值得信赖且更具道德设计的 AI 开辟了新方向。

> Artificial intelligence (AI) systems powered by large language models have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, enabling a wide range of applications through natural language interaction. As AI agents proliferate in our daily lives, their generic and uniform expressiveness presents a significant limitation to their appeal and adoption. Personality expression represents a key prerequisite for creating more human-like and distinctive AI systems. We show that AI models can express deterministic and consistent personalities when instructed using established psychological frameworks, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on model capabilities. We find that more advanced models like GPT-4o and o1 demonstrate the highest accuracy in expressing specified personalities across both Big Five and Myers-Briggs assessments, and further analysis suggests that personality expression emerges from a combination of intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Our results reveal that personality expression operates through holistic reasoning rather than question-by-question optimization, with response-scale metrics showing higher variance than test-scale metrics. Furthermore, we find that model fine-tuning affects communication style independently of personality expression accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for creating AI agents with diverse and consistent personalities, which could significantly enhance human-AI interaction across applications from education to healthcare, while additionally enabling a broader range of more unique AI agents. The ability to quantitatively assess and implement personality expression in AI systems opens new avenues for research into more relatable, trustworthy, and ethically designed AI.
