> 基于市场的智能体是一种强化学习智能体，其行动决策基于内部的次级智能体市场。我们提出了一种新型的基于市场的算法，其中状态被分解为多个被称为“商品轴”的维度，这使得该算法相较于现有基于市场的强化学习算法具备更强的专业化和并行能力。我们进一步认为，基于市场的算法有望解决当前AI领域的诸多挑战，包括搜索、动态扩展和完全反馈等问题，并证明这些算法可被视为对神经网络的泛化。最后，我们列举了将市场算法与大型语言模型结合的多种创新方式，以实现其在实际应用中的直接落地。

> Market-based agents refer to reinforcement learning agents which determine their actions based on an internal market of sub-agents. We introduce a new type of market-based algorithm where the state itself is factored into several axes called ``goods'', which allows for greater specialization and parallelism than existing market-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, we argue that market-based algorithms have the potential to address many current challenges in AI, such as search, dynamic scaling and complete feedback, and demonstrate that they may be seen to generalize neural networks; finally, we list some novel ways that market algorithms may be applied in conjunction with Large Language Models for immediate practical applicability.
