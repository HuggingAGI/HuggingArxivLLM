# 摘要

> 人工智能的迅猛发展推动了智能决策技术在人机对抗中的超越，尤其在复杂多智能体协作任务中表现突出。多智能体协作决策涉及多个智能体协同完成任务并达成目标，广泛应用于自动驾驶、无人机导航、灾害救援及模拟军事对抗等领域。本文首先全面调研了多智能体协作决策的领先仿真环境和平台，从任务格式、奖励分配及技术基础等多维度深入分析这些环境。接着，我们概述了多智能体系统（MAS）中主流的决策方法、算法和模型，这些方法可分为五类：基于规则（模糊逻辑）、基于博弈论、基于进化算法、基于深度多智能体强化学习（MARL）及基于大型语言模型（LLMs）推理。鉴于MARL和基于LLMs方法相较于传统规则、博弈论和进化算法的优势，本文重点探讨了利用MARL和LLMs技术的多智能体方法，深入分析其分类、优缺点，并展望了未来研究方向及潜在挑战。

> With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.
