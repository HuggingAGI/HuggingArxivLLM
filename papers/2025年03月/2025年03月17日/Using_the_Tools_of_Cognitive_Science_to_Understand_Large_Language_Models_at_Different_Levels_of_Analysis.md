> Using the Tools of Cognitive Science to Understand Large Language Models at Different Levels of Analysis

# 摘要

> 现代人工智能系统，如大型语言模型，正变得越来越强大，但也越来越难以理解。我们将其类比为历史上理解人类思维的困难，认为认知科学中发展出的方法可用于理解大型语言模型。我们提出了一种基于马尔分析的框架，旨在通过重新审视与每个分析层次相关的认知科学方法，并展示其揭示大型语言模型行为和内部组织的潜力，为理解这些新型智能系统提供工具包。

> Modern artificial intelligence systems, such as large language models, are increasingly powerful but also increasingly hard to understand. Recognizing this problem as analogous to the historical difficulties in understanding the human mind, we argue that methods developed in cognitive science can be useful for understanding large language models. We propose a framework for applying these methods based on Marr's three levels of analysis. By revisiting established cognitive science techniques relevant to each level and illustrating their potential to yield insights into the behavior and internal organization of large language models, we aim to provide a toolkit for making sense of these new kinds of minds.
