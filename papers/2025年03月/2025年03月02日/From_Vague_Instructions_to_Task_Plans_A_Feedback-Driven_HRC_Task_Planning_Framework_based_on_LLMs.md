> From Vague Instructions to Task Plans: A Feedback-Driven HRC Task Planning Framework based on LLMs

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）近期在人机协作（HRC）场景中展现出强大的规划潜力，为传统规划方法提供了极具前景的替代方案。LLMs能够通过推理自然语言输入生成结构化计划，具备跨多样任务的泛化能力，并能灵活适应人类指令。本文重点研究LLMs在人机协作任务中的规划潜力，特别是其从高层次模糊人类输入中进行推理的能力，以及根据实时反馈调整计划的能力。我们提出了一种结合LLMs与人类反馈的新型混合框架，用于生成动态且情境感知的任务计划。研究还展示了如何通过单一简洁的提示应对广泛的任务和环境，突破了以往研究中常用冗长详细结构化提示的限制。通过将用户偏好整合到规划循环中，我们确保生成的计划不仅有效，还能与人类意图保持一致。

> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as planners in human-robot collaboration (HRC) scenarios, offering a promising alternative to traditional planning methods. LLMs, which can generate structured plans by reasoning over natural language inputs, have the ability to generalize across diverse tasks and adapt to human instructions. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs to facilitate planning in the context of human-robot collaborative tasks, with a focus on their ability to reason from high-level, vague human inputs, and fine-tune plans based on real-time feedback. We propose a novel hybrid framework that combines LLMs with human feedback to create dynamic, context-aware task plans. Our work also highlights how a single, concise prompt can be used for a wide range of tasks and environments, overcoming the limitations of long, detailed structured prompts typically used in prior studies. By integrating user preferences into the planning loop, we ensure that the generated plans are not only effective but aligned with human intentions.
