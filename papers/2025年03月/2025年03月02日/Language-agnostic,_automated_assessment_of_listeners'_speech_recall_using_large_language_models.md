# 摘要

> 老年人在理解口语方面常常遇到困难。传统的语音测试由于未能模拟日常对话的丰富语境，且通常仅提供一种官方语言版本，导致其他语言母语者的评估结果不准确。本研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs），在英语及其他10种语言的母语者中，实现了高质量口语故事的自动生成和多语言语音回忆的高效评分。参与者在安静和噪声环境中用母语听取并回忆简短故事。通过LLM文本嵌入和语义相似性分析，发现语音回忆评分对时间顺序、首因/近因效应和背景噪声具有敏感性，且各语言的回忆分数高度相似。与传统方法相比，本研究突破了简单语音材料和封闭母语群体测试的局限，实现了跨语言回忆数据的高精度映射。语音生成和评分的全流程自动化为具有临床应用潜力的自然口语理解评估提供了重要解决方案。

> Speech-comprehension difficulties are common among older people. Standard speech tests do not fully capture such difficulties because the tests poorly resemble the context-rich, story-like nature of ongoing conversation and are typically available only in a country's dominant/official language (e.g., English), leading to inaccurate scores for native speakers of other languages. Assessments for naturalistic, story speech in multiple languages require accurate, time-efficient scoring. The current research leverages modern large language models (LLMs) in native English speakers and native speakers of 10 other languages to automate the generation of high-quality, spoken stories and scoring of speech recall in different languages. Participants listened to and freely recalled short stories (in quiet/clear and in babble noise) in their native language. LLM text-embeddings and LLM prompt engineering with semantic similarity analyses to score speech recall revealed sensitivity to known effects of temporal order, primacy/recency, and background noise, and high similarity of recall scores across languages. The work overcomes limitations associated with simple speech materials and testing of closed native-speaker groups because recall data of varying length and details can be mapped across languages with high accuracy. The full automation of speech generation and recall scoring provides an important step towards comprehension assessments of naturalistic speech with clinical applicability.
