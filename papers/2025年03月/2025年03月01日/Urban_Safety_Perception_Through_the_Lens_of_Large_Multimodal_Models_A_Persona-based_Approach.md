> Urban Safety Perception Through the Lens of Large Multimodal Models: A Persona-based Approach

# 摘要

> 理解城市环境在安全方面的感知对于城市规划和政策制定至关重要。传统方法如调查在高成本、所需时间和可扩展性问题上受到限制。为了解决这些挑战，本研究引入了大型多模态模型（LMMs），特别是Llava 1.6 7B，作为一种新颖的方法，利用街景图像评估城市空间的安全感知。此外，研究还探讨了不同社会人口统计学视角（通过模型模拟的基于角色提示）对该任务的影响。在不进行额外微调的情况下，该模型在将城市场景分类为安全或不安全方面平均F1得分为59.21%，并识别出三个感知不安全的关键因素：孤立、物理衰败和城市基础设施挑战。此外，整合基于角色的提示揭示了年龄、性别和国籍等社会人口统计学群体在安全感知上的显著差异。老年和女性角色始终比年轻或男性角色感知到更高的不安全性。同样，不同国籍在不安全分类比例上也存在差异，从新加坡的19.71%到博茨瓦纳的40.15%。值得注意的是，模型的默认配置与中年男性角色最为接近。这些发现凸显了LMMs作为传统方法的可扩展和经济有效的替代方案在城市安全感知评估中的潜力。尽管这些模型对社会人口统计学因素的敏感性强调了谨慎部署的必要性，但它们提供细致入微视角的能力使其成为AI驱动的城市规划的有前景工具。


> Understanding how urban environments are perceived in terms of safety is crucial for urban planning and policymaking. Traditional methods like surveys are limited by high cost, required time, and scalability issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically Llava 1.6 7B, as a novel approach to assess safety perceptions of urban spaces using street-view images. In addition, the research investigated how this task is affected by different socio-demographic perspectives, simulated by the model through Persona-based prompts. Without additional fine-tuning, the model achieved an average F1-score of 59.21% in classifying urban scenarios as safe or unsafe, identifying three key drivers of perceived unsafety: isolation, physical decay, and urban infrastructural challenges. Moreover, incorporating Persona-based prompts revealed significant variations in safety perceptions across the socio-demographic groups of age, gender, and nationality. Elder and female Personas consistently perceive higher levels of unsafety than younger or male Personas. Similarly, nationality-specific differences were evident in the proportion of unsafe classifications ranging from 19.71% in Singapore to 40.15% in Botswana. Notably, the model's default configuration aligned most closely with a middle-aged, male Persona. These findings highlight the potential of LMMs as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for urban safety perceptions. While the sensitivity of these models to socio-demographic factors underscores the need for thoughtful deployment, their ability to provide nuanced perspectives makes them a promising tool for AI-driven urban planning.
