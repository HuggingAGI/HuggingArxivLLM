> Graph-Based Re-ranking: Emerging Techniques, Limitations, and Opportunities

# 摘要

> 知识图谱在检索增强生成（RAG）中作为上下文增强的数据存储候选方案展现出巨大潜力。因此，图表示学习技术与主流神经信息检索方法（如两阶段检索，也称为重排序）同时得到了探索。尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在重排序任务中的图学习展现了出色的能力，但在构建和评估用于训练与评估的图结构方面仍存在诸多限制，特别是在段落和文档排序任务中。本文综述了新兴的基于GNN的排序模型架构及其对应的图表示构建方法，并基于社区面临的共同挑战与机遇，提出了未来研究方向的建议。

> Knowledge graphs have emerged to be promising datastore candidates for context augmentation during Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). As a result, techniques in graph representation learning have been simultaneously explored alongside principal neural information retrieval approaches, such as two-phased retrieval, also known as re-ranking. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to demonstrate proficiency in graph learning for re-ranking, there are ongoing limitations in modeling and evaluating input graph structures for training and evaluation for passage and document ranking tasks. In this survey, we review emerging GNN-based ranking model architectures along with their corresponding graph representation construction methodologies. We conclude by providing recommendations on future research based on community-wide challenges and opportunities.
