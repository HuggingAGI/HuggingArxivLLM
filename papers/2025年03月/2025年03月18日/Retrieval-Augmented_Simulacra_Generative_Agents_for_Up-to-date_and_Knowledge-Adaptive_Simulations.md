# 摘要

> 根据2023版《信息与通信》白皮书的预测，日本社交网络服务的用户数量预计在2022年突破1亿，其影响力也在持续扩大。与此同时，基于社交网络服务的营销活动和情绪、信息传播研究正蓬勃开展，这推动了对预测社交网络互动趋势的系统需求。我们开发了一个创新系统，通过构建虚拟社交网络环境，利用智能体在由智能体创建的聊天社区中使用LLMs进行发帖和回复，从而模拟社交网络上各种社区的行为。本文通过仿真系统，重点评估了用于生成发帖和回复的搜索扩展生成机制对生成能力和自然度的影响。评估结果表明，我们提出的模仿人类搜索行为的生成机制能够生成最自然的互动交流，展现了显著的优势。

> In the 2023 edition of the White Paper on Information and Communications, it is estimated that the population of social networking services in Japan will exceed 100 million by 2022, and the influence of social networking services in Japan is growing significantly. In addition, marketing using SNS and research on the propagation of emotions and information on SNS are being actively conducted, creating the need for a system for predicting trends in SNS interactions. We have already created a system that simulates the behavior of various communities on SNS by building a virtual SNS environment in which agents post and reply to each other in a chat community created by agents using a LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the search extension generation mechanism used to create posts and replies in a virtual SNS environment using a simulation system on the ability to generate posts and replies. As a result of the evaluation, we confirmed that the proposed search extension generation mechanism, which mimics human search behavior, generates the most natural exchange.
