> CARE: A QLoRA-Fine Tuned Multi-Domain Chatbot With Fast Learning On Minimal Hardware

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型在特定领域问答任务中表现优异，但模型微调需要大量时间和硬件资源。我们提出CARE（客户协助与响应引擎），这是一个轻量化模型，仅需极小硬件和数据量，通过微调Phi3.5-mini打造而成，专注于电信、医疗和银行三大领域的客户支持。在电信和银行领域，CARE能有效解决客户常见问题。在医疗领域，CARE提供基础诊断和就医建议，作为专业医疗咨询的补充。由于基于Phi3.5-mini，CARE支持移动设备运行，提升了适用性。研究显示，CARE在多个医疗基准测试中表现优异，证明其可作为基础医疗建议工具。

> Large Language models have demonstrated excellent domain-specific question-answering capabilities when finetuned with a particular dataset of that specific domain. However, fine-tuning the models requires a significant amount of training time and a considerable amount of hardware. In this work, we propose CARE (Customer Assistance and Response Engine), a lightweight model made by fine-tuning Phi3.5-mini on very minimal hardware and data, designed to handle queries primarily across three domains: telecommunications support, medical support, and banking support. For telecommunications and banking, the chatbot addresses issues and problems faced by customers regularly in the above-mentioned domains. In the medical domain, CARE provides preliminary support by offering basic diagnoses and medical suggestions that a user might take before consulting a healthcare professional. Since CARE is built on Phi3.5-mini, it can be used even on mobile devices, increasing its usability. Our research also shows that CARE performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions.
