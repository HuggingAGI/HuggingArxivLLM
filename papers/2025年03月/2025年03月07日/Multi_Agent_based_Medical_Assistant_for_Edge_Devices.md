> 大型动作模型（LAMs）彻底革新了智能自动化领域，但在医疗行业因隐私、延迟及网络依赖等问题而面临挑战。本报告介绍了一款设备端多智能体医疗助手，成功突破了这些限制。该系统通过小型化、任务专用的智能体优化资源，确保可扩展性和高性能。我们的系统为医疗需求提供一站式服务，包括预约挂号、健康监测、用药提醒和日常健康报告。基于Qwen Code Instruct 2.5 7B模型，规划器和调用智能体在任务规划和调用方面分别达到85.5和96.5的平均RougeL评分，同时保持轻量化以适应设备端部署。这一创新方法结合了设备端系统与多智能体架构的优势，为用户导向的医疗解决方案开辟了新途径。

> Large Action Models (LAMs) have revolutionized intelligent automation, but their application in healthcare faces challenges due to privacy concerns, latency, and dependency on internet access. This report introduces an ondevice, multi-agent healthcare assistant that overcomes these limitations. The system utilizes smaller, task-specific agents to optimize resources, ensure scalability and high performance. Our proposed system acts as a one-stop solution for health care needs with features like appointment booking, health monitoring, medication reminders, and daily health reporting. Powered by the Qwen Code Instruct 2.5 7B model, the Planner and Caller Agents achieve an average RougeL score of 85.5 for planning and 96.5 for calling for our tasks while being lightweight for on-device deployment. This innovative approach combines the benefits of ondevice systems with multi-agent architectures, paving the way for user-centric healthcare solutions.
