# 摘要

> 气候变化加剧了极端野火的威胁，使其成为人类文明面临的最危险的自然灾害之一。虽然部分野火可能由人类活动引发，但其蔓延主要受环境因素影响，例如：(1) 气象条件（如温度、风向、风速和湿度）；(2) 本地干燥植被的数量和类型；(3) 地形条件，影响降雨量和火灾动态。因此，准确预测野火的发生已成为全球最紧迫的环境挑战之一。在本研究中，我们开发了一种实时多模态Transformer神经网络模型，结合先进AI技术和统计方法，实时精准预测野火发生位置。该模型不仅利用了小时级天气预报数据，还结合Google地球图像获取的局部地形和植被数据，预测小范围（100平方米）内的野火概率及其时间。通过训练1992年至2015年美国野火数据，该模型可基于实时天气预报和Google地球图像，提供未来24小时内任意小区域的野火发生概率。

> Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most dangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.
