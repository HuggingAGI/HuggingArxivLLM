# 摘要

> 多模态总结通过整合多种数据模式的信息，为理解各类流程中的信息提供了创新解决方案。然而，在模型化工程（MBE）领域，尽管多模态总结已成为复杂系统设计与开发的基石，但其应用和优势尚未得到充分关注。UML和EMF图作为模型化工程的核心工具，蕴含了丰富的多模态信息和复杂的关联数据。本研究旨在探索多模态大型语言模型在模型化工程中的应用潜力，评估其对UML和EMF图中关系、特征及功能的理解与识别能力。通过汽车软件开发的实际案例，我们希望揭示多模态总结在提升模型化工程实践生产力和准确性方面的变革潜力与局限性。研究过程中，我们参考了众多先进的模型，以确保评估的全面性与深度。

> Multimodal summarization integrating information from diverse data modalities presents a promising solution to aid the understanding of information within various processes. However, the application and advantages of multimodal summarization have not received much attention in model-based engineering (MBE), where it has become a cornerstone in the design and development of complex systems, leveraging formal models to improve understanding, validation and automation throughout the engineering lifecycle. UML and EMF diagrams in model-based engineering contain a large amount of multimodal information and intricate relational data. Hence, our study explores the application of multimodal large language models within the domain of model-based engineering to evaluate their capacity for understanding and identifying relationships, features, and functionalities embedded in UML and EMF diagrams. We aim to demonstrate the transformative potential benefits and limitations of multimodal summarization in improving productivity and accuracy in MBE practices. The proposed approach is evaluated within the context of automotive software development, while many promising state-of-art models were taken into account.
