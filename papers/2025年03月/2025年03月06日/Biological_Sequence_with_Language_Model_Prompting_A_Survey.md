# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）已崭露头角，成为应对跨领域挑战的强大工具。近期研究表明，LLMs在生物分子分析与合成效率方面有显著提升，吸引了学术界与医学界的广泛关注。本文系统性地探索了基于提示的方法在生物序列中的应用，包括DNA、RNA、蛋白质以及药物发现任务。我们专注于提示工程如何使LLMs解决特定领域的难题，如启动子序列预测、蛋白质结构建模及药物靶点结合亲和力预测，通常在有限标签数据的情况下。此外，我们还探讨了提示在生物信息学中的变革潜力，并针对数据稀缺性、多模态融合及计算资源限制等关键挑战进行了深入分析。本文旨在成为该领域的入门指南，并激发持续创新。

> Large Language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing challenges across diverse domains. Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that large language models significantly enhance the efficiency of biomolecular analysis and synthesis, attracting widespread attention from academics and medicine. In this paper, we systematically investigate the application of prompt-based methods with LLMs to biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and drug discovery tasks. Specifically, we focus on how prompt engineering enables LLMs to tackle domain-specific problems, such as promoter sequence prediction, protein structure modeling, and drug-target binding affinity prediction, often with limited labeled data. Furthermore, our discussion highlights the transformative potential of prompting in bioinformatics while addressing key challenges such as data scarcity, multimodal fusion, and computational resource limitations. Our aim is for this paper to function both as a foundational primer for newcomers and a catalyst for continued innovation within this dynamic field of study.
