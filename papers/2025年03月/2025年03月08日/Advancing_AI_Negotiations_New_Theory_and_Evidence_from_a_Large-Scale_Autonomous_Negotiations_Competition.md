> Advancing AI Negotiations: New Theory and Evidence from a Large-Scale Autonomous Negotiations Competition

# 摘要

> 尽管AI谈判代理蓬勃发展，但将计算机科学研究与传统谈判理论相结合以开发新AI谈判理论的努力仍然有限。为填补这一空白，我们举办了国际AI谈判竞赛，参赛者逐步优化大型语言模型（LLM）谈判代理的提示词。随后，我们在多个场景中促成了这些代理之间超过120,000次的谈判。研究发现，传统人类-人类谈判理论中的基本原则在AI-AI谈判中仍然至关重要。具体而言，高亲和力的代理能提升对方主观价值，达成协议更频繁，从而在整合型谈判中创造和获取更多价值。然而，一旦达成协议，亲和力强的代理获取价值较少，而主导型代理则获取更多。这些结果与强调关系构建、坚定态度和充分准备的经典谈判理论相吻合。我们的分析还揭示了AI-AI谈判中的独特动态，现有理论无法完全解释，特别是关于链式推理和提示注入等AI特定策略的有效性。获胜代理采用了传统框架与AI方法相结合的策略。这些结果凸显了建立整合传统理论与AI策略的新谈判理论的重要性，以优化代理性能。研究表明，这一新理论需考虑自主代理的独特特性，并明确传统理论在自动化环境中的适用条件。

> Despite the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation agents, there has been limited integration of computer science research and established negotiation theory to develop new theories of AI negotiation. To bridge this gap, we conducted an International AI Negotiations Competition in which participants iteratively designed and refined prompts for large language model (LLM) negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 120,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that fundamental principles from established human-human negotiation theory remain crucial in AI-AI negotiations. Specifically, agents exhibiting high warmth fostered higher counterpart subjective value and reached deals more frequently, which enabled them to create and claim more value in integrative settings. However, conditional on reaching a deal, warm agents claimed less value while dominant agents claimed more value. These results align with classic negotiation theory emphasizing relationship-building, assertiveness, and preparation. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by negotiation theory, particularly regarding the effectiveness of AI-specific strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. The agent that won our competition implemented an approach that blended traditional negotiation preparation frameworks with AI-specific methods. Together, these results suggest the importance of establishing a new theory of AI negotiations that integrates established negotiation theory with AI-specific strategies to optimize agent performance. Our research suggests this new theory must account for the unique characteristics of autonomous agents and establish the conditions under which traditional negotiation theory applies in automated settings.
