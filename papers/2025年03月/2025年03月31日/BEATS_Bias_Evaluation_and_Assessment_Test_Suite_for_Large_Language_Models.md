> BEATS: Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite for Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 本研究推出BEATS——一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）偏见、伦理、公平性和事实性的创新框架。基于此框架，我们构建了一个涵盖29项独特指标的偏见基准。这些指标全面覆盖人口统计、认知、社会偏见，以及伦理推理、群体公平和事实性相关的错误信息风险。通过这些指标，我们能够量化评估LLMs生成的回应在延续社会偏见、加剧系统性不平等方面的潜在影响。要在该基准中获得高分，模型必须展现出极高的公平性，成为负责任AI评估的严苛标准。实验数据显示，37.65%的领先模型输出存在某种偏见，凸显了在关键决策系统中使用这些模型的风险。BEATS框架提供了一种可扩展且统计严谨的方法，用于评估LLMs、诊断偏见成因并制定缓解策略。我们的目标是助力开发更符合社会责任与伦理标准的AI模型。

> In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially responsible and ethically aligned AI models.
