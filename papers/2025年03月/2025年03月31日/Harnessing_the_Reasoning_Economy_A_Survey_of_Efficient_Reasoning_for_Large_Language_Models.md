> Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）近期的能力提升，使其从快速直觉思维（System 1）转向了更深入的推理方式（System 2）。System 2推理虽然提升了任务的准确性，但其缓慢的思考特性和低效的推理行为往往导致高昂的计算成本。而System 1推理虽计算高效，却常导致表现不佳。因此，如何在性能与计算成本之间找到平衡，即实现推理经济，成为关键。本综述全面分析了LLMs在训练后和推理阶段的推理经济，涵盖推理低效的原因、不同推理模式的行为分析以及实现推理经济的潜在解决方案。通过提供实用见解并指出开放挑战，我们希望为提升LLMs推理经济性策略提供启发，助力这一快速发展的领域研究。此外，我们还提供了一个公共仓库，持续跟踪该领域的最新动态。

> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.
