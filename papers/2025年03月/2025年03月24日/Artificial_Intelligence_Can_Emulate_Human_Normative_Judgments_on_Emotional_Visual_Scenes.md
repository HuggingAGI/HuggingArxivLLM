> Artificial Intelligence Can Emulate Human Normative Judgments on Emotional Visual Scenes

# 摘要

> 情感反应根植于生物学基础，但人类情绪概念的形成也受到语言和高级认知的影响。最近，人工智能领域取得了一项重大突破：多模态语言模型展现了惊人的智力能力。然而，它们对情感刺激的反应尚未被深入研究。本研究探讨了当前最先进的多模态系统能否在标准化图像集上模拟人类的情感评分，涵盖情感维度和基本离散情绪。令人惊讶的是，AI的判断与人类平均评分高度吻合。这表明，尽管这些系统并未经过专门训练以匹配人类情感反应，但通过统计学习大规模图像及其语言描述数据库，视觉判断情感内容的能力自然浮现。这不仅揭示了语言在人工智能中构建丰富情感概念的关键作用，也为多模态人工智能技术的伦理应用提供了重要启示。

> Affective reactions have deep biological foundations, however in humans the development of emotion concepts is also shaped by language and higher-order cognition. A recent breakthrough in AI has been the creation of multimodal language models that exhibit impressive intellectual capabilities, but their responses to affective stimuli have not been investigated. Here we study whether state-of-the-art multimodal systems can emulate human emotional ratings on a standardized set of images, in terms of affective dimensions and basic discrete emotions. The AI judgements correlate surprisingly well with the average human ratings: given that these systems were not explicitly trained to match human affective reactions, this suggests that the ability to visually judge emotional content can emerge from statistical learning over large-scale databases of images paired with linguistic descriptions. Besides showing that language can support the development of rich emotion concepts in AI, these findings have broad implications for sensitive use of multimodal AI technology.
