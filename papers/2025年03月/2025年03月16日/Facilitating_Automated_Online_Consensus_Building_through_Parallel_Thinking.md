> Facilitating Automated Online Consensus Building through Parallel Thinking

# 摘要

> 共识构建因利益相关者的多样化意见而具有挑战性。有效的促进对于支持共识构建和高效团队决策至关重要，但常受经验不足和可扩展性限制。本研究提出了一种基于平行思考的促进代理（PTFA），用于在线、文本共识构建。PTFA自动收集文本帖子，并利用大型语言模型（LLMs）同时执行六顶思考帽技术中的六种角色。通过试点研究，PTFA在想法生成、情感探测和深入分析方面的能力得到验证。此外，我们构建了一个包含参与者间及参与者与代理间对话的综合数据集，供未来研究使用。

> Consensus building is inherently challenging due to the diverse opinions held by stakeholders. Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes. The PTFA automatically collects textual posts and leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform all of the six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking. To illustrate the potential of PTFA, a pilot study was carried out and PTFA's ability in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of ideas was demonstrated. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.
