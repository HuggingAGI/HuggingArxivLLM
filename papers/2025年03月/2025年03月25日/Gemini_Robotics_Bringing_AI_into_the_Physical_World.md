# 摘要

> 大规模多模态模型的突破性进展在数字领域催生了卓越的通用能力，但将其应用于物理代理（如机器人）仍面临重大挑战。本报告介绍了一种专为机器人设计的全新AI模型系列，该系列基于Gemini 2.0构建。我们推出了Gemini Robotics——一款先进的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）通用模型，能够直接控制机器人。它不仅能够流畅、灵敏地执行各类复杂操作任务，还具备对物体类型和位置变化的鲁棒性，能够应对未知环境，并遵循多样化、开放词汇的指令。通过额外微调，Gemini Robotics还能扩展至更多新能力，包括解决长时域、高灵巧性任务，仅需100个演示即可学习新的短时域任务，以及适应全新的机器人形态。这得益于Gemini Robotics建立在我们在此工作中介绍的第二个模型——Gemini Robotics-ER（具身推理）的基础上。Gemini-Robotics-ER将Gemini的多模态推理能力扩展到物理世界，增强了空间和时间理解。这使得与机器人相关的功能成为可能，包括目标检测、指向、轨迹和抓取预测，以及多视图对应和三维边界框预测。我们展示了这种创新组合如何支持各种机器人应用。我们还深入探讨并解决了与这一新型机器人基础模型相关的安全考虑。Gemini Robotics系列标志着向开发通用机器人迈出的重要一步，实现了AI在物理世界中的巨大潜力。

> Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.
