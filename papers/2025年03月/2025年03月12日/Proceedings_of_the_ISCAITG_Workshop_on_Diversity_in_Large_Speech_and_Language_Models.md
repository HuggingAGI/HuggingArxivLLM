# 摘要

> 机器学习技术在语音识别、信息抽取、文本和语音生成以及人机交互等领域取得了突破性进展，这些技术通常依赖于大型语言模型（LLMs）来表示语言和语音特征，并经过大量数据训练。然而，人类与这些技术的交互效果受到语言适应性的影响，未能适应的用户可能无法有效使用这些技术。此外，由于市场需求驱动，代表性不足的语言和方言可能被边缘化，而数据缺失的少数语言将进一步加剧数字鸿沟。本次研讨会将从计算机科学和语言学的视角探讨这一问题。


> Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).
