> This survey investigates foundational technologies essential for developing effective Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems. Aiming to answer how best to optimize these systems for collaborative, dynamic environments, we focus on four critical areas: Architecture, Memory, Planning, and Technologies/Frameworks. By analyzing recent advancements and their limitations - such as scalability, real-time response challenges, and agent coordination constraints, we provide a detailed view of the technological landscape. Frameworks like the Mixture of Agents architecture and the ReAct planning model exemplify current innovations, showcasing improvements in role assignment and decision-making. This review synthesizes key strengths and persistent challenges, offering practical recommendations to enhance system scalability, agent collaboration, and adaptability. Our findings provide a roadmap for future research, supporting the creation of robust, efficient multi-agent systems that advance both individual agent performance and collective system resilience.
