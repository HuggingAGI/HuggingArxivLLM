# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）代理在教育领域的自动化任务和创新推动中表现非凡。本报告系统回顾了教育领域中LLM代理的最新研究，将其分为两大类：(1) \emph{教学代理}，专注于自动化复杂教学任务，助力教师与学生；(2) \emph{领域特定教育代理}，专为科学教育、语言学习和职业发展等特定领域设计。我们深入探讨了支撑这些代理的技术进展，包括关键数据集、基准测试和算法框架，这些是其高效运作的核心。同时，我们分析了隐私、偏见与公平性、幻觉缓解及与现有教育生态系统的整合等关键挑战。本报告旨在为教育领域的LLM代理提供全面的技术概述，促进进一步研究与合作，以最大化其对学习者与教育者的积极影响。

> Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating tasks and driving innovation across diverse educational applications. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art research on LLM agents in education, categorizing them into two broad classes: (1) \emph{Pedagogical Agents}, which focus on automating complex pedagogical tasks to support both teachers and students; and (2) \emph{Domain-Specific Educational Agents}, which are tailored for specialized fields such as science education, language learning, and professional development. We comprehensively examine the technological advancements underlying these LLM agents, including key datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks that drive their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges such as privacy, bias and fairness concerns, hallucination mitigation, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological overview of LLM agents for education, fostering further research and collaboration to enhance their impact for the greater good of learners and educators alike.
